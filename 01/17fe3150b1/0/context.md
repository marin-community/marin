## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

ok, in @lib/marin/src/marin/processing/tokenize/tokenize.py there's some logging, but it's not very informative. If it's possible and cheap, I would like to add logging that would show how many tokens are we producing in seconds, also how many documents/s? Suggest more stats if they are inexpensive to produce. Follow @docs/recipes/fix_issue.md

### Prompt 2

ok, use f strings in the logging, use `,` to make big numbers more readable
