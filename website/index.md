# Marin

Marin is an open community for building foundation models—together.
We’re training state-of-the-art models from scratch, and sharing every step: the code, the data, the experiments, the mistakes.
Marin is also a framework: a modular system for running and reproducing large-scale experiments, from raw data to final models.

## What is Marin?

Marin is an effort to train foundation models from scratch in the open—starting from raw data and ending with fully evaluated checkpoints.
You can see the entire process—from early experiments to final checkpoints, including our successes and our mistakes.
That means you can reproduce everything, audit decisions, and build on each step of the process.

You can read more in our announcement post: XXX.

### Join Us

You can also join us as we work to build open foundation models. Marin is a collaborative effort—we want contributors, not just consumers.
We have several ways you can get involved:


- Read our experiments as [reports in GitHub Issues](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aexperiment)
  or [experiment scripts](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/tree/main/experiments).
- Browse our [Weights & Biases reports](XXX ). XXX make autogenerated list of links to check in?
- Try the [Marin Speedrun](XXX) to test new architectures and optimizers.
- Contribute to [Marin Datashop](XXX), our effort to improve dataset filtering and quality.
- Help generate [scaling laws](XXX) and analyze model behaviors.
- Join us in planning discussions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/J9CTk7pqcM) and discuss our [largest runs](XXX).
- Pitch in with the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/marin-community/marin). Here's a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
and [help wanted issues](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

### Results

Here are some of our results:

- May 2025: [Marin 8b](XXX) is an 8B open-source LLM that XXX Llama 3.1 8b on MMLU and XXX.
- [] XXX

#### More to come!

There's lots more in the pipeline, including a [32B model](XXX), potentially a [70B model](XXX), and more.
