# Unlabeled evaluation campaign

This directory contains every version-controlled input for the campaign: model configs, Evalchemy
configs, Harbor configs, the co-hosted judge config, model-specific Harbor policy values, validation,
and launch commands. The launcher reads the Harbor and Evalchemy revisions from Marin's external
dependency declarations and checks the Harbor lockfile before submission.

The launcher leaves `EvalRunRecord.version` unset. Its checked-in inputs, config digests, and durable
records support reproduction and review; they do not attest that a run conforms to an accepted eval
policy. Policy conformance requires the independently trusted evidence and verifier described in
[issue #9458](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/9458). The preflight and comparison work
in [PR #9461](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/pull/9461) must consume that trusted decision
before presenting a run as policy-conformant.

Pass `--version LABEL` only when a submitter-controlled cohort label is useful. The launcher forwards
the label to Marin unchanged. It remains provenance metadata and does not alter the conformance
boundary above.

Use `--version eval-policy-2026-09-29-verified` to check the frozen campaign settings before submission
and exclude incompatible records from EvalDash comparisons. The frozen profile in
`lib/marin/src/marin/evaluation/policies/september_29.json` preserves the campaign's benchmark
settings, model-specific Harbor limits, and evaluator revisions. Partial benchmark subsets are
allowed; different model YAMLs retain distinct comparison identities. These checks use
submitter-provided records; independent policy attestation remains pending in
[issue #9458](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/9458).

```bash
./launch-campaign.sh --version eval-policy-2026-09-29-verified --model Qwen-Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
```

From a clean checkout of the campaign's pinned Marin commit:

```bash
cd experiments/evaluation/campaigns/eval-campaign-09-25-unlabeled
./validate-campaign.sh
./launch-campaign.sh --model Qwen-Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
./launch-campaign.sh --submit --model Qwen-Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
```

The first launch command is a dry run. `--suite nonagentic` and `--suite agentic` select one full
mechanism. Repeat `--evalchemy NAME` or `--harbor NAME` to select individual configs; pair a selector
with its corresponding suite to avoid launching the other mechanism. `--wait` waits for durable
records and requires CoreWeave object-store credentials.

The launcher writes generated effective configs beneath
`experiments/evaluation/campaigns/.launch-staging/` and local provenance snapshots beneath
`experiments/evaluation/campaigns/.launch-snapshots/`. Both paths are ignored by Git. Durable
`record.json` files contain the effective model and evaluator configuration, repository revision,
and Harbor policy digest.

Credentials are operational inputs. Export `HF_TOKEN`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, and CoreWeave object-store
credentials, or use the configured Google Secret Manager access. Set `EVAL_CAMPAIGN_SECRETS_ENV` only
when reading Hugging Face or Together credentials from a local environment file.
