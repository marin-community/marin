# Unlabeled evaluation campaign

This directory contains every version-controlled input for the campaign: model configs, Evalchemy
configs, Harbor configs, the co-hosted judge config, model-specific Harbor policy values, validation,
and launch commands. The launcher reads the Harbor and Evalchemy revisions from Marin's external
dependency declarations and checks the Harbor lockfile before submission.

From a clean checkout of the campaign's pinned Marin commit:

```bash
cd experiments/evaluation/campaigns/eval-campaign-09-25-unlabeled
./validate-campaign.sh
./launch-campaign.sh --model Qwen-Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
./launch-campaign.sh --submit --model Qwen-Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
```

The first launch command is a dry run. `--suite nonagentic` and `--suite agentic` select one full
mechanism. Repeat `--evalchemy NAME` or `--harbor NAME` to select individual configs; pair a selector
with its corresponding suite to avoid launching the other mechanism. `--wait` waits for durable
records and requires CoreWeave object-store credentials.

The launcher writes generated effective configs beneath
`experiments/evaluation/campaigns/.launch-staging/` and local provenance snapshots beneath
`experiments/evaluation/campaigns/.launch-snapshots/`. Both paths are ignored by Git. Durable
`record.json` files contain the effective model and evaluator configuration, repository revision,
and Harbor policy digest.

Credentials are operational inputs. Export `HF_TOKEN`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, and CoreWeave object-store
credentials, or use the configured Google Secret Manager access. Set `EVAL_CAMPAIGN_SECRETS_ENV` only
when reading Hugging Face or Together credentials from a local environment file.
