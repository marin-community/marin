This is a hello-world speedrun that trains a tiny model, and is designed to run on a single **GPU**.
See https://github.com/marin-community/marin/tree/main/docs/how-to-guides/submitting-speedrun.md for
further documentation around submitting speedrun, and for a more detailed walkthrough of the code
and process.
