      "\n",
      "Note: this article describes the SIMD support in versions 5.3 thru 6.1 of the Intel IPP library. The minimum SIMD requirements have changed with release 7.0 of the Intel IPP libary. For more information regarding the SIMD optimization layers present in the Intel IPP 7.0 library please read the article titled Understanding SIMD Optimization Layers and Dispatching in the Intel® IPP 7.0 Library.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Intel IPP library contains a collection of functionally identical processor-specific optimized libraries that are “dispatched” at run-time. The “dispatcher” chooses which of these processor-specific optimized libraries to use when your application makes a call into the IPP library. This is done to maximize each function’s use of the underlying SIMD instructions and other architecture-specific features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: you can build custom processor-specific libraries that do not require the dispatcher, but that is outside the scope of this article. Please read this IPP linkage models article for information on how to build custom versions of the IPP library.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dispatching refers to the process of detecting CPU features at run-time and then selecting the Intel IPP optimized library set that corresponds to your CPU. For example, in the \\ia32\\bin directory, the ippiv8-x.x.dll library file contains version ‘x.x’ of the optimized image processing libraries for Intel® Core™ 2 Duo processors; ‘ippi’ refers to the image processing library, ‘v8’ refers to the Core 2 architecture, and ‘x.x’ refers to the library’s major version numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the general case, the “dispatcher” identifies the run-time processor only once, at library initialization time. It sets an internal table or variable that directs your calls to the internal functions that match your architecture. For example, ippsCopy_8u(), may have multiple implementations stored in the library, with each version optimized to a specific Intel® processor architecture. Thus, the p8_ippsCopy_8u() version of ippsCopy_8u() is called by dispatcher when running on an Intel Core 2 Duo processor on IA-32, because it is optimized for this processor architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: IPP architectures generally correspond to SIMD (MMX, SSE, AES, etc.) instructions sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initializing the IPP Dispatcher\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of identifying the specific processor being used, and initialization of the dispatcher, should be performed before you make any calls into the IPP library. If you are using a dynamic link library this process is handled automatically when the dynamic link library is initialized. However, if you are using a static library you must perform this step manually. See this article on the ipp*Init*() functions for more information on how to do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following table lists all the architecture codes defined by the Intel IPP library through version 6.1 of the product.

      "\n",
      "Within the 32-bit p8 and equivalent 64-bit y8 architectures there is an additional \"run-time\" dispatching mechanism, a kind of mini-dispatcher. The Nehalem (Intel Core i7) and Westmere processor families add additional SIMD instructions beyond those defined by SSE4.1. The Nehalem processor family adds the SSE4.2 SIMD instructions and the Westmere family adds AES-NI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating two additional internal versions of the IPP library for the SSE4.2 and AES-NI instructions would be very space inefficient, so they are bundled as part of the SSE4.1 library. When you call a function that includes, for example, AES-NI optimizations, an additional jump directs your call to the AES-NI version within the p8/y8 library. Because the enhancements affect the optimization of only a small number of IPP functions, this additional overhead occurs infrequently and only when your application is executing on a p8/y8 architecture processor.\n",
      "\n",
      "S8/N8 (Atom) Dispatch\n",
      "\n",
      "The s8/n8 library (Atom-optimized) is not present in the static libraries, only in the dynamic libraries. However, IPP applications built with the static library will run on an Atom processor with very good to equivalent performance using the v8/u8 library (which is automatically dispatched, you do not need to do anything special for the Atom processor).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Linux distributions of the IPP library include a separate Atom-specific version of the library. However, you do not need to use this Atom-specific library if you are building an IPP application that will be run on multiple processor platforms, including Atom processors. This Atom-only version of the library is provided as a convenience for building IPP applications that will run ONLY on an Atom, as opposed to IPP applications that may run on a variety of processor platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental difference between the s8/n8 and v8/u8 libraries are the compiler options used to build them, which accommodates the differences in the construction of the instruction pipelines between the Atom and other SSSE3 processors. Both libraries are Supplemental SSE3 libraries and the s8/n8 version of the IPP library does not use any Atom-unique instructions, so no features are lost by running the v8/u8 slice of the library on an Atom processor. Also, these two variations in the library (s8/n8 and v8/u8) give nearly identical performance on an Atom.\n",

It contains a list of Intel processors showing which processors support which SIMD instructions. For the latest table please refer to the original article; it gets updated on a regular basis. Please note that the behavior of the Intel Compiler SIMD dispatcher described in that article does not apply to the Intel IPP library.\n",

      "The Universe sends us light at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, most of this light does not reach us at ground level here on Earth. Why? Because we have an atmosphere which blocks out many types of radiation while letting other types through. Fortunately for life on Earth, our atmosphere blocks out harmful, high energy radiation like X-rays, gamma rays and most of the ultraviolet rays. It also block out most infrared radiation, as well as very low energy radio waves. On the other hand, our atmosphere lets visible light, most radio waves, and small wavelength ranges of infrared light through, allowing astronomers to view the Universe at these wavelengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the infrared light coming to us from the Universe is absorbed by water vapor and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. Only in a few narrow wavelength ranges, can infrared light make it through (at least partially) to a ground based infrared telescope.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Earth's atmosphere causes another problem for infrared astronomers. The atmosphere itself radiates strongly in the infrared, often putting out more infrared light than the object in space being observed. This atmospheric infrared emission peaks at a wavelength of about 10 microns (micron is short for a micrometer or one millionth of a meter).\n",
      "\n",
      "So the best view of the infrared universe, from ground based telescopes, are at infrared wavelengths which can pass through the Earth's atmosphere and at which the atmosphere is dim in the infrared. Ground based infrared observatories are usually placed near the summit of high, dry mountains to get above as much of the atmosphere as possible. Even so, most infrared wavelengths are completely absorbed by the atmosphere and never make it to the ground.\n",

This is why it is so important to send observatories into space, to get above our atmosphere which prevents so much of this valuable information from reaching us.\n",

      "Since most infrared light is blocked by our atmosphere, infrared astronomers have placed instruments onboard, rockets, balloons, aircraft and space telescopes to view regions of the infrared which are not detectable from the ground.

Even the chairman of the Colorado Republican Party said Mr. Salazar was well-liked and respected in the district.\n",

      "Mr. Salazar, a potato farmer by trade, is locked in a battle with Republican Scott Tipton, a state legislator who owns a pottery business. Four years ago, Mr. Salazar crushed Mr. Tipton, winning by 25 percentage points. The rematch, however, is a nail-biter.\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent poll commissioned by the National Republican Congressional Committee—but also cited by Mr. Salazar's campaign—found the race tied at 45% each, prompting the Republican group to announce Wednesday that it was committing $700,000 to the race. An outside group that doesn't disclose its donors, Americans for Job Security, recently bought nearly $500,000 of ads attacking Mr. Salazar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Republicans see the district, which stretches across Western Colorado, as fertile ground. Its voters backed the Republican presidential nominee in the last three contests and the Republican Party has gained more than 6,000 registered voters just since February, while Democrats have lost 700. Voter registration now stands at roughly 38% Republican, 33% Democrat and 29% unaffiliated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wearing blue jeans, a checked shirt and ostrich-skin cowboy boots, Mr. Tipton made a point of telling voters at a recent campaign stop here of his deep local roots. Then he pivoted to his campaign's central theme: tying Mr. Salazar to the unpopular Democratic leadership in Washington, D.C. Mr. Tipton repeatedly points out that Mr. Salazar has voted with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about 97% of the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Salazar emphasizes that he broke with his party on several key issues, opposing the cap-and-trade energy bill and the bank bailout and calling for a year-long extension of the Bush tax cuts for all income groups. He has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association and rated a centrist by the National Journal.\n",

      "For his part, Mr. Salazar, an older brother of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, has tried to paint Mr. Tipton as an extremist. He points out that earlier in the campaign, Mr. Tipton called for cutting government by 50%. Mr. Tipton now says he supports a 10% cut in all non-military discretionary spending. A spokesman called that \"the first step\" to fiscal responsibility but wouldn't say whether a 50% cut remains the goal.\"It's tough out there,\" Mr. Salazar said. \"The way things are going, I could walk on water and be criticized for not swimming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The two candidates have also clashed in increasingly nasty TV ads.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one, Mr. Salazar calls his rival a \"multi-millionaire banker\" and implies he profited from the bank bailout. Mr. Tipton did sit on the board of a financial institution several years ago—as did Mr. Salazar—but didn't have direct involvement with the bailout. As for the label \"multi-millionaire,\" Mr. Tipton acknowledges his small business has been successful. \"We've done OK,\" he says. \"I hope that's not a sin in America.\"\n",
