"""
This is @dlwh's "YOLO"/vibes run described in https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/600.

The idea is/was to train a 8B model continuously updating the mixture, data, and anything else. With WSD-S,
there's no "middle" or "end" of the run, there's just the run. So we'll just train for a long time, updating as we go.

We call it "tootsie" because tootsie rolls are famously made by folding in the previous batch of tootsie roll into the
next batch, so we're folding in the previous mixture into the next mixture.

For now, we're training on DCLM's best mix, but that will change.

# You will see in many, many places in this file that I (dlwh) made many, many mistakes.
