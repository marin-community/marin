His mother died from childbirth complications, and he was hit very hard by her death. He raised his son, until he was forced to enlist as a soldier in the Great Pokemon War. He fought for eight years, and when he was returning home, he received a message. His son developed a terminal illness, and was dying as he read the message. He drove as fast as he could, and barely made it to the hospital. Ash told his father about how the nice nurse brought a Pikachu for him to play with. He coughed and wheezed violently. The father held him close, but Ash's grip slipped from him. The father gradually went insane after losing his only son. His foster parent's told him about how greatly he wanted to become a Pokemon master.
