**Statement of attribution:**
- This code was seeded from [nelson-liu/rbloom-gcs](https://github.com/nelson-liu/rbloom-gcs).
- Bloom filters were originally proposed in [(Bloom, 1970)](https://doi.org/10.1145/362686.362692). Furthermore, this  implementation makes use of a constant recommended by [(L'Ecuyer, 1999)](https://doi.org/10.1090/S0025-5718-99-00996-5) for  redistributing the entropy of a single hash over multiple integers using a  linear congruential generator.
