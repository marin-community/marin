In `ZephyrCoordinator` there's `_wait_for_stage` take takes `no_workers_timeout` with default 60 seconds. I want that to be configurable. I don't know if it should be an env variable, or a zephyr flag. Follow @docs/recipes/fix_issue.md

ok, now let's dump the default 60s value to 10minutes if it's a Ray cluster context

No that's wrong, it's not enough to check if it's a LocalClient, check if it's fray.v2.ray_backend.backend.RayClient, but put it in a try/except

ok, actually remove the try import except, it's unnecessary. Also update help messages and references to local/distrubted
