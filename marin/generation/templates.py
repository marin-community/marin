Help me decide the types of training data to look for to train a
language model for an evaluation with data similar to the
above.
You should keep the description brief and it is okay to generalize
or abstract specific details to do so.
Give your answer in three sections, first write what type of test
this might be from, then write out the languages, skills and
knowledge the language model would need, and finally write a
description of the ideal training data for the evaluation.
