    Environment for the OlymMATH dataset, a novel Olympiad-level mathematical benchmark, designed to rigorously
    test the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs. OlymMATH features 200 meticulously curated problems,
    each manually verified and available in parallel English and Chinese versions. The problems are
    systematically organized into two distinct difficulty tiers: (1) AIME-level problems (easy) that
    establish a baseline for mathematical reasoning assessment, and (2) significantly more challenging problems
    (hard) designed to push the boundaries of current state-of-the-art models.
