Create an exp2956_sft_swe_smith_qwen3_8b.py that trains on https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlienKevin/SWE-smith-rs-gpt-5-mini-trajectories, referencing @experiments/exp2601_sft_openthoughts_agent_v1_qwen3_8b.py

---

Can you create a new branch called kevin/swe_smith based off of main (the original sft branch that kevin/agentic-sft was based on should already be merged into main) at git worktree marin-swe-smith. And then move this new experiment script there?

---

Why didn't we need the json.loads(conversation) before for exp2601_sft_openthoughts_agent?

---

How are the conversations rendered into tokens?

---

How should the tool calls be encoded in the messages?

---

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

---

don't worry about the swe-smith dataset, just tell me what format the existing sft pipeline expect

---

so is the expected tool call format OpenAI or HuggingFace?
