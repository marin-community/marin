## Guidelines for Coding Agents in Marin

This document provides a starting point for using coding agents (AI or human) in the Marin project.

- Begin with the agent-friendly recipes in `docs/recipes/`.
- The first step for dataset addition is schema inspection. See the [add_dataset.md](recipes/add_dataset.md) recipe for details.
- Follow the rules and examples in each recipe to ensure compatibility and automation-friendliness.

> This file will be expanded as agent workflows and best practices evolve.
