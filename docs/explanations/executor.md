# Executor Framework

!!! note "Documentation Moved to Thalas"
    The executor framework has been factored out into a separate package called [Thalas](https://github.com/marin-community/thalas).

    For the complete documentation, please see the [Executor Explanation](https://github.com/marin-community/thalas/blob/main/docs/explanations/executor.md) in the Thalas repository.

## Quick Migration Note

Simply update your imports from `marin.execution` to `thalas.execution`. All functionality remains the same.

For tutorials, API reference, and detailed explanations, visit the [Thalas documentation](https://github.com/marin-community/thalas/tree/main/docs).
