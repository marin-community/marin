# Overview

## Quality Classifiers

This topic includes several issues related to the development and evaluation of quality classifiers. Key experiments include:

- Training classifiers on different positive examples, such as ELI5, OpenHermes, and StackExchange ([#164](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/164), [#596](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/596)).
- Comparing fastText versus BERT for quality classifiers ([#163](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/163)).
- Exploring ensemble methods for quality classifiers ([#615](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/615)).
- Investigating different approaches to classify reasoning traces ([#616](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/616)) and explicit low-quality data ([#618](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/618)).

## Experiments on Scaling Laws

Several experiments are mentioned that explore scaling laws and their implications:

- Understanding scaling laws for quality classifiers ([#669](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/669)).
- Applying MuP for scaling laws analyses ([#621](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/621)).

## Model Development and Training

This area focuses on different model training strategies and architectures:

- The development of Tootsie models, including [Tootsie 8B](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/600), [Tootsie 70B](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/750), and others under the Tootsie umbrella ([#140](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/140)).
- Studies of learning rate schedules ([#764](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/764)) and optimizer configurations ([#725](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/725)).

## Data Preparation and Preprocessing

This section concerns experiments and methodologies for preparing and filtering data:

- HTML to text conversion methods were compared to improve pretraining quality ([#246](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/246)).
- Compression-ratio quality filters were tested to enhance performance ([#633](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/633)).
- Experimenting with extraction methods for data preparation, particularly focusing on datasets like Fineweb-edu and Stack Exchange ([#660](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/660)).

## Reproductions and Replications

Efforts to reproduce previous experiments and benchmark them:

- Reproducing Olmo SFT results using specific datasets ([#227](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/227), [#606](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/606)).
- Replicating DCLM results with different settings and scales ([#102](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/102)).
