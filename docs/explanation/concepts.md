# Core Concepts

This document provides an overview of the key concepts and principles that underpin the Marin project. It serves as a foundation for understanding the system's architecture, experimental methodology, and development practices.

## System Architecture

Marin is built with a modular architecture centered around several core components:

### Experiment Manager
- Handles the lifecycle of experiments
- Manages experiment state and coordination
- Ensures reproducibility and tracking

### Data Pipeline
- Handles data ingestion and preprocessing
- Manages feature engineering
- Implements data validation

### Model Registry
- Manages model versioning
- Stores model metadata
- Handles model deployment

### Execution Engine
- Manages task scheduling
- Handles resource allocation
- Enables parallel execution

## Experimental Methodology

### What is an Experiment?
An experiment in Marin represents a unit of inquiry with a specific hypothesis or goal. Each experiment is:
- Captured in a GitHub issue with the `experiments` tag
- Implemented as a sequence of steps in the `experiments` directory
- Designed to test specific changes to the model building process

### Experiment Lifecycle
1. **Planning**
   - Define hypothesis or goal
   - Specify changes to be tested
   - Document expected outcomes

2. **Implementation**
   - Create experiment file in `experiments` directory
   - Define steps using the executor framework
   - Implement necessary code changes

3. **Execution**
   - Run sanity checks locally
   - Perform dry runs
   - Execute full experiment

4. **Analysis**
   - Review results in data browser
   - Analyze metrics in wandb
   - Document findings

## Development Practices

### Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular design
- Type-safe interfaces

### Documentation
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Clear architecture documentation
- Detailed experiment records

### Quality Assurance
- Unit tests for critical components
- Type hints throughout
- Consistent code style

## Key Principles

1. **Reproducibility**
   - All experiments are fully reproducible
   - Clear dependency tracking
   - Versioned artifacts

2. **Transparency**
   - Open development process
   - Documented design decisions
   - Clear experiment tracking

3. **Modularity**
   - Independent components
   - Clear interfaces
   - Reusable code

4. **Scalability**
   - Distributed execution
   - Resource management
   - Parallel processing
