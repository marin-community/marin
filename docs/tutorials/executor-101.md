# Executor 101

!!! note "Documentation Moved to Thalas"
    The executor framework has been factored out into a separate package called [Thalas](https://github.com/marin-community/thalas).

    For the complete Executor 101 tutorial, please see the [Executor 101 Tutorial](https://github.com/marin-community/thalas/blob/main/docs/tutorials/executor-101.md) in the Thalas repository.

## Quick Start

The executor framework is now in the `thalas` package. Update your imports and continue using it exactly as before:

```python
from thalas.execution import executor_main, ExecutorStep
```

Visit the [Thalas tutorials](https://github.com/marin-community/thalas/tree/main/docs/tutorials) for complete documentation.
