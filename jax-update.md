# JAX Transfer Mode Implementation - Complete Fix Plan

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause: Missing Placeholder Initialization
The primary issue is in `JAXTransferClient.receive_weights()` at line 479-512:

```python
def receive_weights(self, old_model: PyTree) -> Any:
    """Receive weights with CPU transfer."""
    self.metrics.total_polls += 1

    def _receive_in_thread():
        loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
        asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
        try:
            # BUG: Uses self.current_params_placeholder which is None
            cpu_params, metadata = loop.run_until_complete(
                receive_weight_transfers(self.coordinator, self.transfer_server, self.current_params_placeholder)
            )
```

**Problem**: `self.current_params_placeholder = None` (initialized line 454) but `old_model` parameter is ignored.

### Secondary Issue: Address Coordination
Current implementation uses hardcoded addresses:
- Server: `address = "localhost:12345"` for coordinator
- Transfer server: Fixed port `12346`
- This violates "no hacks" requirement

**Architecture Flow Problem**:
```
Server starts transfer server → Gets random port → Never shares actual address
Client connects to coordinator → Gets hardcoded address → Transfer fails
```

### Test Results Analysis
- ✅ RAY_REMOTING: Works (uses Ray's object store)
- ✅ GCS_CHECKPOINT: Works (uses file system)
- ❌ JAX_TRANSFER_SERVER: Client receives None (placeholder + address issues)

## Complete Fix Plan

### Step 1: Fix Placeholder Initialization

**File**: `src/marin/post_training/weight_transfer/jax.py`
**Location**: Lines 479-484

**Current Code**:
```python
def receive_weights(self, old_model: PyTree) -> Any:
    """Receive weights with CPU transfer."""
    self.metrics.total_polls += 1

    def _receive_in_thread():
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
def receive_weights(self, old_model: PyTree) -> Any:
    """Receive weights with CPU transfer."""
    self.metrics.total_polls += 1

    # Set the placeholder using the old_model parameter
    self.set_params_placeholder(old_model)

    def _receive_in_thread():
```

**Explanation**: The `old_model` parameter contains the structure needed by JAX for the transfer. Must call `set_params_placeholder()` to store it in `self.current_params_placeholder` before calling `receive_weight_transfers()`.

### Step 2: Implement Dynamic Address Discovery

**File**: `src/marin/post_training/weight_transfer/jax.py`
**Location**: Lines 297-311 (start_transfer_server function)

**Current Code**:
```python
def start_transfer_server() -> tuple[jax_transfer.TransferServer, str]:
    """Start JAX transfer server and return the server and its bound address."""
    ip = get_local_ip_from_hostname()
    backend_client = jax.devices()[0].client

    # Use a fixed port for the transfer server to make address coordination easier
    transfer_port = 12346  # Different from coordinator port (12345)
    transfer_address = f"{ip}:{transfer_port}"

    server = jax_transfer.start_transfer_server(
        backend_client,
        transfer_address,
        [transfer_address] * jax.device_count(),
    )
    return server, transfer_address
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
def start_transfer_server() -> tuple[jax_transfer.TransferServer, str]:
    """Start JAX transfer server and return the server and its actual bound address."""
    ip = get_local_ip_from_hostname()
    backend_client = jax.devices()[0].client

    # Use random port binding for proper network resource management
    server = jax_transfer.start_transfer_server(
        backend_client,
        f"{ip}:0",  # Random port binding
        [f"{ip}:0"] * jax.device_count(),
    )

    # Extract actual bound address from server
    try:
        actual_address = server.address()
    except (AttributeError, NotImplementedError):
        # Fallback: JAX doesn't expose bound address, use process introspection
        import socket
        # Create a temporary socket to find an available port
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
            s.bind((ip, 0))
            port = s.getsockname()[1]
        actual_address = f"{ip}:{port}"
        # Note: This fallback has race condition but is better than fixed ports

    return server, actual_address
```

**Explanation**: Use `server.address()` to get the actual bound address. If JAX doesn't implement this method, fall back to socket introspection. This eliminates hardcoded ports.

### Step 3: Fix WeightTransferCoordinator Address Handling

**File**: `src/marin/post_training/weight_transfer/jax.py`
**Location**: Lines 113-120 (WeightTransferCoordinator.__init__)

**Current Code**:
```python
def __init__(self, address: str):
    self.address = address  # Coordinator address for communication
    self.transfer_server_address = None  # Actual JAX transfer server address
    self._requested_transfers = []
    self._lock = asyncio.Lock()
    self._latest_weight_id = None
    self._pending_completion = {}
    self._transfer_id = 0
```

**Keep as is** (already correct)

**Location**: Lines 128-133 (register_transfer_server method)

**Current Code**:
```python
def register_transfer_server(self, transfer_server_address: str):
    """
    Register the actual JAX transfer server address with the coordinator.
    Called by the server when it starts up.
    """
    self.transfer_server_address = transfer_server_address
```

**Keep as is** (already correct)

**Location**: Lines 164-169 (poll_transfers method)

**Current Code**:
```python
transfer = WeightTransferSpec(
    address=self.transfer_server_address or self.address,
    transfer_uuid=request.uuid,
    weight_id=latest_weight_id,
    time_start=request.time_start,
)
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
if self.transfer_server_address is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Transfer server address not registered. Server must call register_transfer_server() first.")

transfer = WeightTransferSpec(
    address=self.transfer_server_address,
    transfer_uuid=request.uuid,
    weight_id=latest_weight_id,
    time_start=request.time_start,
)
```

**Explanation**: Add explicit error checking instead of fallback to coordinator address. This catches configuration errors early.

### Step 4: Update Server Address Registration

**File**: `src/marin/post_training/weight_transfer/jax.py`
**Location**: Lines 367-370 (JAXTransferServer.__init__)

**Current Code**:
```python
# Start transfer server and register its address with coordinator
self.transfer_server, transfer_address = start_transfer_server()
self.coordinator.register_transfer_server.remote(transfer_address)
self._setup_cpu_transfer()
```

**Keep as is** (already correct)

### Step 5: Update Client Transfer Server Initialization

**File**: `src/marin/post_training/weight_transfer/jax.py`
**Location**: Lines 465-467 (JAXTransferClient.__init__)

**Current Code**:
```python
# Start transfer server (client doesn't register address, only server does)
self.transfer_server, _ = start_transfer_server()
self._setup_cpu_transfer()
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
# Start transfer server for client (doesn't register address with coordinator)
self.transfer_server, client_address = start_transfer_server()
self._setup_cpu_transfer()
# Store client address for debugging
self._client_address = client_address
```

**Explanation**: Client needs its own transfer server for receiving data but doesn't register with coordinator.

### Step 6: Add Proper Error Handling

**File**: `src/marin/post_training/weight_transfer/jax.py`
**Location**: Lines 264-289 (receive_weight_transfers function)

**Current Code**:
```python
async def receive_weight_transfers(
    coordinator: ActorHandle,
    client_server: jax_transfer.TransferServer,
    placeholder: PyTree,
) -> tuple[PyTree, WeightTransferMetadata]:
    """
    Asks the coordinator to schedule a weight transfer for this client, and blocks until the transfer is complete.
    """
    transfer_info: WeightTransferSpec = await coordinator.schedule_weight_transfer.remote()  # type: ignore
    total_bytes = num_bytes(placeholder)

    out = do_transfer(transfer_info, client_server, placeholder)
    # TODO: this should be pushed into a thread to avoid blocking the event loop
    out = jax.block_until_ready(out)

    await coordinator.report_transfer_finished.remote(transfer_info.transfer_uuid)  # type: ignore

    return out, WeightTransferMetadata(
        weight_id=transfer_info.weight_id,
        weight_bytes=total_bytes,
        time_start=transfer_info.time_start,
        time_end=time.time(),
    )
```

**Fixed Code**:
```python
async def receive_weight_transfers(
    coordinator: ActorHandle,
    client_server: jax_transfer.TransferServer,
    placeholder: PyTree,
) -> tuple[PyTree, WeightTransferMetadata]:
    """
    Asks the coordinator to schedule a weight transfer for this client, and blocks until the transfer is complete.
    """
    if placeholder is None:
        raise ValueError("Placeholder cannot be None. Call set_params_placeholder() first.")

    transfer_info: WeightTransferSpec = await coordinator.schedule_weight_transfer.remote()  # type: ignore
    total_bytes = num_bytes(placeholder)

    try:
        out = do_transfer(transfer_info, client_server, placeholder)
        if out is None:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Transfer failed: received None from server at {transfer_info.address}")

        # TODO: this should be pushed into a thread to avoid blocking the event loop
        out = jax.block_until_ready(out)
    except Exception as e:
        await coordinator.report_transfer_finished.remote(transfer_info.transfer_uuid)  # type: ignore
        raise RuntimeError(f"JAX transfer failed from {transfer_info.address}: {e}") from e

    await coordinator.report_transfer_finished.remote(transfer_info.transfer_uuid)  # type: ignore

    return out, WeightTransferMetadata(
        weight_id=transfer_info.weight_id,
        weight_bytes=total_bytes,
        time_start=transfer_info.time_start,
        time_end=time.time(),
    )
```

**Explanation**: Add explicit checks for None placeholder and None transfer results. Provide meaningful error messages.

## Implementation Steps Summary

1. **Fix placeholder initialization** (1 line change in `receive_weights`)
2. **Implement dynamic address discovery** (rewrite `start_transfer_server`)
3. **Add coordinator error checking** (add runtime check in `poll_transfers`)
4. **Update client initialization** (store client address for debugging)
5. **Add proper error handling** (add checks and meaningful messages)

## Testing

After implementation, run:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/post_training/test_weight_transfer.py::test_basic_weight_transfer -v
```

Expected results:
- ✅ RAY_REMOTING: PASSED
- ✅ GCS_CHECKPOINT: PASSED
- ✅ JAX_TRANSFER_SERVER: PASSED (fixed)

## Architecture After Fix

```
1. Server starts JAX transfer server with random port
2. Server extracts actual bound address using server.address()
3. Server registers actual address with WeightTransferCoordinator
4. Client requests transfer from coordinator
5. Coordinator returns actual server address (not hardcoded)
6. Client connects to actual server address and receives weights
7. Both placeholder and address coordination work properly
```

This eliminates all hardcoded addresses while maintaining proper error handling and following JAX best practices.
