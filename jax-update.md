JAX Transfer Mode Testing Implementation - Status Report

  Goals

  Enable comprehensive testing for the JAX weight transfer mode in the Marin post-training system by:
  1. Creating clean coordinator management without external dependencies
  2. Adding multiprocess tests that properly isolate JAX processes
  3. Integrating JAX transfer mode into existing test suite
  4. Validating end-to-end functionality with proper TPU/device handling

  Current Status

  ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

  1. Added coordinator_name field to WeightTransferConfig
    - Location: /home/power/marin/src/marin/post_training/weight_transfer/base.py:80
    - Added coordinator_name: str = "weight_transfer_coordinator" field
    - Enables consistent coordinator sharing between server/client
  2. Created generic get_or_create_actor helper
    - Location: /home/power/marin/src/marin/post_training/weight_transfer/__init__.py:52-83
    - Function: get_or_create_actor(actor_class, name, *args, max_retries=3, **kwargs)
    - Handles both RayWeightCoordinator and WeightTransferCoordinator
    - Includes retry logic with exponential backoff for race conditions
  3. Removed coordinator parameters from factory functions
    - Updated create_weight_transfer_server() and create_weight_transfer_client()
    - Removed coordinator dependency injection
    - Clean API with only config, mesh, and axis_mapping parameters
  4. Updated JAXTransferServer/Client to use get_or_create_actor
    - Location: /home/power/marin/src/marin/post_training/weight_transfer/jax.py:337-350, 435-447
    - Both classes now internally create/get coordinators using config.coordinator_name
    - Uses address "localhost:12345" for JAX coordinator communication
  5. Updated RayRemotingServer/Client to use get_or_create_actor
    - Location: /home/power/marin/src/marin/post_training/weight_transfer/ray.py:68-76, 129-140
    - Both classes internally handle coordinator lifecycle
    - No external coordinator creation required
  6. Updated tests to use new coordinator management
    - Removed create_coordinator imports and usage
    - Added JAX_TRANSFER_SERVER to parametrized test modes
    - Updated all test functions to use ray_tpu_cluster fixture
    - Added CPU-only JAX environment setting for test compatibility
  7. Fixed device transfer implementation
    - Replaced incorrect mesh.shard() with proper jax.device_put() calls
    - Handles both sharded and unsharded device placement scenarios

  üîÑ Current Issue

  JAX Transfer Mode Coordination Problem
  - Symptom: Server processes weight transfers (logs show "Processed 1 weight transfers") but client receives None
  - Location: Test failure in test_basic_weight_transfer[JAX_TRANSFER_SERVER]
  - Root Cause: Likely timing or coordination issue between server and client processes

  Test Results:
  ‚úÖ RAY_REMOTING: PASSED
  ‚úÖ GCS_CHECKPOINT: PASSED
  ‚ùå JAX_TRANSFER_SERVER: Client receives None instead of weights

  Detailed Task List

  üö® Priority 1 - Fix JAX Transfer Coordination

  1. Debug JAX coordinator communication
    - Add detailed logging to WeightTransferCoordinator actor methods
    - Verify coordinator address resolution between processes
    - Check if server and client are using same coordinator instance
  2. Fix client placeholder initialization
    - Current: self.current_params_placeholder = None in JAXTransferClient
    - Need to: Set placeholder in set_params_placeholder() method
    - Required for: receive_weight_transfers() call in client
  3. Validate server transfer server setup
    - Ensure start_transfer_server() properly initializes with correct address
    - Verify server-client address matching for JAX experimental.transfer

  Priority 2 - Complete Multiprocess Testing

  4. Fix multiprocess test Ray initialization
    - Current: Subprocess Ray init fails with permission errors
    - Solution: Use shared Ray cluster or proper subprocess isolation
    - Location: /home/power/marin/tests/post_training/test_jax_transfer_multiprocess.py
  5. Validate JAX distributed initialization in subprocesses
    - Ensure jax.distributed.initialize() works properly
    - Test coordinator_address propagation between processes
    - Verify device isolation with XLA_FLAGS

  Priority 3 - Testing Robustness

  6. Add comprehensive error handling tests
    - Coordinator failures and recovery
    - Network timeout scenarios
    - Concurrent client stress testing
  7. Add performance benchmarking
    - Compare transfer speeds across all modes
    - Memory usage profiling
    - Large model weight transfer validation

  Technical Architecture

  Clean Coordinator Management Flow

  Config(coordinator_name="test_123")
      ‚Üì
  create_weight_transfer_server(config)
      ‚Üì
  JAXTransferServer.__init__()
      ‚Üì
  get_or_create_actor(WeightTransferCoordinator, "test_123", address)
      ‚Üì
  [Server and Client share same coordinator via name]

  Current Test Infrastructure

  - Environment: CPU-only JAX (JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu)
  - Ray Cluster: Using ray_tpu_cluster fixture from conftest.py
  - Test Coverage: 3 modes √ó 8 test scenarios = 24 test cases
  - Status: 16/24 passing (Ray + GCS modes work, JAX mode has coordination issue)

  Next Steps

  1. Immediate: Debug why JAX coordinator isn't properly mediating server-client communication
  2. Short-term: Complete multiprocess test implementation
  3. Medium-term: Add comprehensive error scenarios and performance tests
  4. Long-term: Validate on actual TPU hardware with proper device sharding

  The foundation is solid with clean coordinator management implemented. The remaining work focuses on debugging the JAX-specific coordination logic and
  completing the multiprocess test validation.
