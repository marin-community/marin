Marin is a modular, open-source framework for the research and development of
foundation models.  A key property of Marin is reproducibility: All the steps
raw data to the final model are recorded for posterity (not just the final
model).  Moreover, all [experiments](docs/explanation/experiments.md) (whether successful
or not) are also recorded, so the entire research process (not just the
development of the final model) is transparent.

For getting started and installation please see our [documentation](docs/index.md) or visit our [readthedocs](https://marin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
