# Marin

> "*I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship."*<br/>

Marin is a modular, open-source framework for the research and development of
foundation models.  A key property of Marin is reproducibility: All the steps
raw data to the final model are recorded for posterity (not just the final
model).  Moreover, all [experiments](docs/experiments.md) (whether successful
or not) are also recorded, so the entire research process (not just the
development of the final model) is transparent.

The core part of Marin is minimal, consisting of basically an [executor
framework](docs/executor.md), which manages the execution of a set of
arbitrary steps.

Marin's primary use case is to build a language model like Llama 3,
which involves data curation, transformation, filtering, tokenization,
training, and evaluation (see [overview](docs/lm/overview.md)).
Note that for now, all this specific code resides in this repository.

## Setup

To install Marin, create a new virtual environment (or `conda` environment)
with the appropriate Python version (3.10), and then run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanford-crfm/marin
cd marin
pip install -e ".[extras]"
```

This will install all the core dependencies and build `marin` as a Python
package. Installing the `[extras]` requirements will additionally install test,
linting, and debugging dependencies (e.g., `pytest`).

## Tests

The first time you run tests locally, you will need install `pandiff` to
run the snapshot tests. This is a one-time install that can be done using the
following commands:

```bash
brew install node  # For MacOS X
conda install -c conda-forge pandoc
npm install -g pandiff
```

To run the tests, first run `export RAY_ADDRESS=` to run Ray in local mode.

1. We have linters set up to ensure code quality. You can run them with:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
2. To run the tests, run `PYTHONPATH=tests:. pytest tests --durations=0 -n 4 --tb=no -v`

## Hello world example

Let's run your first [hello world experiment](experiments/hello_world.py),
which has two steps:

1. Generate some numbers.
2. Compute some statistics of the numbers.

To run this example (and output), simply type:

```bash
python experiments/hello_world.py --prefix var
```

This command should create the following assets:

1. `var/experiments/hello_world-7063e5.json`: stores a record of all the steps in this experiment.
1. `var/hello_world/data-d50b06`: the output of step 1 (generate some numbers, stored in `numbers.json`).
1. `var/hello_world/stats-b5daf3`: the output of step 2 (compute some statistics, stored in `stats.json`).

Note that if you run the same command again, it will detect that both steps
have been already run and return automatically.

## Data browser

Marin comes with a [data browser](data_browser/README.md) that makes it easy to
view datasets (in various formats) and experiments produced by the executor.
After installing the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
cd data_browser
python server.py --config conf/local.conf
```

Once the server is started, go to
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and navigate around to the
experiment JSON file to get a nicer view of the experiment (the URL is also
printed out when you run the experiment).

See the [data browser README](data_browser/README.md) for more details.
