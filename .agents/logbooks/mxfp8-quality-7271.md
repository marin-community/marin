# MXFP8 Quality Gate: Task Logbook

## Current TL;DR

- The paired launcher is ready at `485e23f7f`: 16 focused tests pass and the final read-only review found no remaining issues.
- The primary gate is a matched-token d2560/L26/E128/top-4 run: 31,474 steps, batch 512, sequence length 4096, and 66,005,762,048 tokens per arm.
- A 20-step, full-topology smoke is next. No quality or performance result is claimed yet.

## Scope

- Goal: determine whether the production hybrid MXFP8 recipe from #7282 preserves training quality while reducing time to a matched loss.
- Primary metrics: paired train-loss delta, final/cooldown-tail loss delta, Paloma macro/domain loss, uncheatable-eval loss, tokens/s, MFU, and time to matched loss.
- Constraints: same seed, data order, schedule, topology, and optimizer; only the FP8 model config may differ. Use region-local `s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin` data and checkpoints.
- Coordinating issue: https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/7271

## Baseline

- Date: 2026-07-19
- Code refs: #7282 implementation at `c3cb334f8`; quality launcher at `485e23f7f`.
- Baseline numbers: the corrected #7282 64-GPU production-shape smoke measured 299,894 tok/s BF16 versus 392,287 tok/s MXFP8/XLA, or 1.308x. That was a 50-step throughput result, not a long-run quality result.

## Entry Log

### 2026-07-19 17:23 - MXFP8Q-001 preflight ready

- Hypothesis: the exact d2560 quality cell compiles, trains, evaluates, checkpoints, and resumes on 8xGB200x4 per arm with finite paired losses and a stable MXFP8 throughput advantage.
- Commit Hash: `485e23f7f4d89d1d2f218c777766497d6a8d7ae4`
- Command: submit two CPU coordinators through Iris, each running `python -m experiments.grug.moe.launch_mxfp8_quality` with `MXFP8_QUALITY_PAIR_ID=MXFP8Q-001-smoke`, `MXFP8_QUALITY_STEPS=20`, and arm `bf16` or `mxfp8`. Pass `WANDB_API_KEY` from agenix and `MARIN_PREFIX=s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin` to each coordinator.
- Config: d2560/L26/E128/top-4, f1280, shared-f2560, seq4096, batch512, seed0; 8 replicas x 4 GB200, mesh replica2/data2/expert8; full MuonH/Newton-Schulz; ring MoE, scanned layers, recompute-all; MXFP8 uses fused grouped experts, per-tensor FP8 dense GEMMs, BF16 EP wire, and the XLA producer. Paloma and uncheatable evaluation run at the forced final callback. Checkpoints are hourly plus forced final on S3.
- Result: pending submission.
- Interpretation: the launcher passed 16 focused tests and a final read-only review with no findings. Four CPU/`recipe="auto"` variant-contract failures are inherited unchanged from #7282.
- Next action: submit and babysit both 20-step arms; require finite loss, final evaluation, S3 checkpoint, and exact-ID resume before the full 31,474-step pair.
