# Issue #6854 fuzzy-dedup false-positive validation, volume 2

Status: running

Coordinating issue: https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/6854

Previous volume:
[issue-6854-dedup-validation.md](issue-6854-dedup-validation.md).

## Objective

Continue the exhaustive baseline-versus-treatment semantic review on the full
115-source, 103,716,988-document DataKit 100B testbed. The pinned arms,
evaluation contract, artifact roots, and results through 153,122 reviewed pairs
are recorded in the previous volume.

## Experiment log

### 2026-07-26T16:07:20Z — 154,658 pairs verified

- `/rav/datakit-6854-audit-next-checkpoints-1623-v426` independently
  revalidated 12 checkpoints: six from p0 decision-file 6 semantic offsets
  4,608 through 5,248 and six from p2 decision-file 70 semantic offsets 1,024
  through 1,664. Their 1,536 pairs contain 1,025 model false positives, 510
  model true duplicates, and one unresolved outcome. Two pairs were chunked
  and 1,534 were direct. All 3,184 judgments were valid on their first request
  attempt.

- In checkpoint order, the outcome Parquet SHA-256 values are:

  - p0:

- Complete-text inspection resolves the ambiguity as a false positive.
  `part-00070-of-00128.parquet:2521` compares 32-line Halsey and Northrop
  family-tree pages. They share Ancestry boilerplate but have different
  surnames, tree counts, census changes and rates, 1940 populations, and four
  demographic facts. Character, line, and word-sequence similarities are
  0.808271, 0.562500, and 0.770833. The 1,066/1,062-character member and
  canonical SHA-256 values are
  `e4f6e42c315402eb7f999a8bab2297b2288a5663a34b2c1f9618470193abbc77`
  and
  `d8862607bb758393fc473ddd6695e035597efd95b96b4dec5d4976926bbbb35e`.

- `/rav/datakit-6854-inspect-row2521-1624-v427` persisted the complete pair and
  diff with inspection SHA-256
  `c9680ba0c11f88dca7f21f60519b85c8fc8662f11a17577b24b19a9fc5a2eae7`.
  `/rav/datakit-6854-publish-row2521-1625-v428` wrote the immutable
  false-positive record, and `/rav/datakit-6854-verify-row2521-1626-v429`
  independently reread the source pair, semantic checkpoint, inspection,
  deterministic Parquet bytes, and completion marker. The semantic-evidence,
  manual-Parquet, and marker SHA-256 values are
  `220fc2c5445bf72917fdc2750b8283b39479b9113bf743bf0d1e1feb58fa53fc`,
  `89e7b8d0d79834937e7d085a48b598957cb2e6e23f9a80df52ed4e097270500c`,
  and `8f70693c7ac6afda2239112f39094d3ea39269b006dfa6af751e8d33b9e8cc9d`.

- Across the stable 1,217-checkpoint snapshot, all 172 unresolved model
  outcomes are covered by 133 true-duplicate and 39 false-positive manual
  records. The adjusted totals are:

  - baseline: 124,335 pairs, 79,138 false positives, 45,197 true duplicates;
  - treatment: 30,323 pairs, 15,662 false positives, 14,661 true duplicates;
  - combined: 154,658 pairs, 94,800 false positives, 59,858 true duplicates.

- The next audit frontiers are p0 `(6, 5,376)`, p1 `(38, 128)`,
  p2 `(70, 1,792)`, and p3 `(103, 0)`. All four batch-priority 2-H100 workers
  continue serving requests. Their 12 root, broker, and GPU pods remain Ready
  with zero Kubernetes restarts.
