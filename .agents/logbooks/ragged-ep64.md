# Ragged EP64: Task Logbook

## Scope

- Goal: Reproduce the selected EP hero with `ragged_all_to_all`, identify the cause of its performance or failures, and test the obvious EP-specific runtime and NCCL controls.
- Primary metrics: median step duration and MFU over steps 5 through 24, token throughput, routing-drop fraction, peak HBM, and terminal correctness.
- Constraints: one GB200 rack, interactive priority, serialized arms, no periodic watch/eval/profile steps, no checkpoints, and no Iris cluster lifecycle changes.
- Coordinating issue/PR: experiment [#8077](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/8077); source PR [#8013](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/pull/8013).
- Experiment prefix: `RA2A`.

## Current TL;DR

The current selected latent-E192 EP hero has no ragged baseline. Historical run MHEP-001 completed the older E128 full-width shape at 14.9614% median MFU and 2.4099% final assignment drops. The first new run will change only the transport to `ragged_all_to_all` on PR #8013, disable periodic metric/eval/profile work, and score steps 5 through 24.

## Current Baseline

- Date: 2026-08-08.
- Code refs: historical baseline `120ccfbe2`; launch source `67c78093d7a3fb464a339ba168e68d1178d157ac`, which integrates PR #8013's EP lineage while retaining main's FSDP launcher.
- Historical numbers: MHEP-001, E128 x i3072, d6144, top-4, capacity factor 1.0, EP64, 25 steps, 14.9614% median MFU, 2.4099% final drops. This is not shape-matched to the selected E192 latent hero.
- Current baseline: pending `RA2A-001`.

## Hypothesis Queue

### Active

- `RA2A-001`: The current PR #8013 ragged flavor completes 25 steps and establishes a usable one-rack baseline. Next test: selected E192 latent hero with only `--flavor ep-ragged` changed.
- `RA2A-002`: XLA latency hiding and four-way collective overlap add scheduling cost or excessive concurrency to dynamic EP collectives. Next test: disable latency hiding, then reduce overlap independently if the baseline completes.
- `RA2A-003`: NCCL NVLS/SHARP settings help only if the ragged lowering uses NCCL. Next test: inspect compile/runtime evidence before allocating a rack to the setting.
- `RA2A-004`: Allocator and NCCL buffer configuration determines whether the selected model reaches the ragged collective. Next test: classify any failure as XLA-pool, NCCL, compiler support, or coordination before changing memory controls.

### Blocked

- None.

### Falsified / Dead End

- None.

### Promoted

- None.

## Decision Log

- 2026-08-08: Run arms serially on one interactive-priority rack. Score steps 5 through 24; treat effects below the ±1.57% single-reading resolution measured in #8054 as unresolved without replication.
- 2026-08-08: Pass `--watch-interval 0 --eval-every 0 --profile-steps 0 --no-save-checkpoints` to keep periodic metric, eval, profile, and checkpoint work out of the timing window.
- 2026-08-08: Test NCCL/SHARP controls only after lowering or logs show that the ragged path reaches NCCL. JAX's GPU implementation may use a peer-pointer kernel instead.

## Negative Results Index

- None.

## Entry Log

### 2026-08-08 22:12 UTC - Investigation opened

- Hypothesis: The selected EP hero can reproduce the historical ragged behavior on the current runtime.
- Commit Hash: PR #8013 head `b80b35887c6e7d523a5440f63c80aba21092f2d1`; launch snapshot pending.
- Command: Pending preflight and issue creation.
- Config: one GB200 rack, EP64, selected E192 x i6272 latent-3072 hero, top-4, capacity factor 1.33, 25 steps, interactive priority, no watch/eval/profile/checkpoint work.
- Result: Historical evidence recovered. MHEP-001 completed a different E128 shape at 14.9614% median MFU and 2.4099% final drops. PR #8013 reports two newer attempts that failed before a valid ragged measurement, one from OOM and one from repeated Gloo startup timeouts.
- Interpretation: Ragged all-to-all is not universally broken. The investigation must first separate current-shape/runtime failures from steady-state collective performance.
- Next action: Create the coordinating experiment issue, integrate PR #8013 onto the current main lineage, validate the launch contract, and submit `RA2A-001`.

### 2026-08-08 22:24 UTC - RA2A-001 launch contract

- Hypothesis: The current E192 latent hero completes 25 steps with `ragged_all_to_all`, producing a clean one-rack performance baseline.
- Commit Hash: `67c78093d7a3fb464a339ba168e68d1178d157ac`, pushed to `origin/weaver/hero-run-why-can-t-we-ragged-all` with a clean worktree before this logbook update.
- Command:

  ```bash
  UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/marin-ragged-uv-cache uv run iris \
    --config lib/iris/config/marin.yaml job run --no-wait \
    --enable-extra-resources --target-cluster cw-us-east-08a \
    --priority interactive --cpu 2 --memory 8GB --disk 32GB \
    --timeout 21600 --max-retries 10 \
    --job-name ra2a-001-ragged-baseline-20260808-coord \
    -e WANDB_API_KEY '<redacted>' \
    -e WANDB_PROJECT marin_moe \
    -e MARIN_PREFIX s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin \
    -- python -m experiments.grug.moe_hero_ep.launch \
    --run-id ra2a-001-ragged-baseline-20260808 \
    --dp-racks 1 --num-steps 25 --flavor ep-ragged \
    --watch-interval 0 --eval-every 0 --profile-steps 0 \
    --no-save-checkpoints --version 2026.08.08 --run
  ```

- Output root: `s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/grug/ra2a-001-ragged-baseline-20260808/2026.08.08`.
- Tracking identity: W&B entity `marin-community`, project `marin_moe`, group `moe-hero-ep`, run name and ID `ra2a-001-ragged-baseline-20260808`, resume policy `allow`.
- Initialization: no checkpoint; optimizer and model initialize from scratch.
- Stop boundary: final step 25. Checkpoints, eval, watch metrics, and profiling are disabled.
- Hardware and topology: 16 workers with four GB200 GPUs each on `cw-us-east-08a`; EP64; one data-parallel rack; interactive priority.
- Runtime choice: let Iris choose the JAX coordinator port through the rank-zero port-selection path from #7994. Do not pin the stale README port. Retain the EP runtime defaults from PR #8013: PGLE, `cuda_async`, latency hiding, overlap limit 4, and command buffers disabled.
- DRI and monitoring: DRI `rjpower`; Codex owns monitoring. Check after startup and then continuously through the terminal state. Stop on non-finite training, allocator or NCCL failure, unsupported ragged lowering, exhausted retries, or failure to complete step 25.
- Preflight evidence: `./infra/pre-commit.py --changed-files --fix` passed; 38 focused Grug tests passed with one skipped; eight Levanter eval tests passed. The dry run resolved the selected E192 x i6272 latent-3072, top-4, capacity-factor-1.33 model and the output/tracking identities above.
- Source bundle and Iris job: pending submission.
- Next action: Commit this contract, submit the coordinator once, record its source bundle and canonical job IDs, and monitor to a terminal state.
