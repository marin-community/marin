# Issue #6854 fuzzy-dedup false-positive validation

Status: running

Coordinating issue: https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/6854

## Objective

Compare the pre-fix fuzzy-dedup implementation with the proposed word-shingle,
direct-canonical-neighbor implementation on the full 115-source 100B Datakit
testbed. Classify every emitted duplicate and every disagreement for false
positives, preserve all intermediate artifacts, and use per-stage finelog
statistics for performance comparisons.

## Pinned arms

- Baseline: `8f1ba5363` (`origin/main` on 2026-07-24), MinHash artifact v2,
  character 5-grams, all connected-component members emitted.
- Treatment: `3605aa714`, MinHash artifact v3, word 5-grams, only the canonical
  and direct canonical neighbors emitted.
- Shared input:
  `s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/datakit/sample_100b_8ae7a94f`.
- Shared parameters: 286 permutations, 26 bands, n-gram size 5, 500,000
  character cap, seed 42, 50 CC iterations with resume enabled.
- Artifact root:
  `s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/user/rav/datakit/dedup-ab/issue6854-100b-20260724-v1`.

## Evaluation contract

1. Read every baseline and treatment duplicate marker.
2. Join every marker back to its full normalized source document.
3. Compute exact character- and word-5-gram similarity, containment, length
   ratio, source crossing, canonical relation, and graph distance.
4. Classify every marker with objective evidence. Semantically inspect every
   baseline/treatment disagreement and every case that objective checks leave
   ambiguous.
5. Verify marker/source cardinality, canonical invariants, CC convergence,
   report statistics, and report HTML data.
6. Compare matched Zephyr stages with finelog `cpu_time_total`,
   `mem_peak_bytes_max`, processed items, and processed bytes. Wall time is
   operational context only.

## Experiment log

### 2026-07-24T06:56:03Z — research isolation and initial inventory

- Created treatment worktree/branch
  `research/rav/6854-dedup-validation` at `3605aa714`.
- Created baseline worktree at `8f1ba5363`; a dedicated baseline research
  branch will carry only the launcher.
- Confirmed the testbed contains 115 normalized source artifacts with
  `/rav/datakit-6854-100b-inspect-20260724`.
- `/rav/datakit-6854-100b-inventory-20260724` failed before reading any
  parquet rows because `pq.ParquetFile` received an unentered
  `fsspec.OpenFile`. The replacement launcher enters the storage context and
  reads parquet footers only.
- The fix PR worktree remains separate and dirty only with pre-existing shared
  CI-selector review refinements. No validation harness is being added to PR
  #7591.

### 2026-07-24T07:03:10Z — exact 100B input inventory

- `/rav/datakit-6854-100b-inventory-v2-20260724` succeeded.
- Exact input size: 115 sources, 768 parquet shards, 103,716,988 documents,
  and 256,440,051,494 compressed parquet bytes.
- Inventory artifact:
  `s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/user/rav/datakit/dedup-ab/issue6854-100b-20260724-v1/inventory.json`.
- The launcher is pinned in treatment commit `97e1c719a` and baseline commit
  `e463145bd`. Its artifact-version guard rejects a treatment invocation on
  v2 code or a baseline invocation on v3 code.
- The treatment requires DupeKit source-build mode because the published
  native wheel does not yet export `NgramKind`. The canonical
  `scripts/rust_mode.py dev` edits remain uncommitted and will be bundled only
  into treatment jobs. The local host lacks `cc`; the CoreWeave task image
  built the same source successfully in the earlier smoke.

### 2026-07-24T07:48:30Z — pinned native wheel and 0.1B smoke

- Built a Linux x86-64 CPython 3.12 ABI3 DupeKit wheel from treatment commit
  `3605aa714` with Zig. SHA-256:
  `dcb15e7c524af67078096481d916fc9feb990d60bb0e92b58682e9da6e1501d8`.
  `/rav/datakit-6854-treatment-wheel-probe-20260724` loaded
  `NgramKind.WORD` and independently reproduced the checksum in CoreWeave.
  The wheel and its temporary lock overrides remain uncommitted and must not
  enter PR #7591.
- Baseline combined-layout smoke
  `/rav/datakit-6854-ab-baseline-combined-smoke-20260724` succeeded over all
  115 sources and 103,848 documents. MinHash produced 2,700,048 buckets and
  truncated 32 documents. Fuzzy dedup emitted 13 members in 5 clusters:
  8 non-canonicals to drop and 103,835 singletons.
- Baseline MinHash execution `20260724-072214-e24a6615` reported 102.35 worker
  CPU-seconds and 628,441,088 peak worker bytes. Baseline fuzzy-dedup final
  stage execution `20260724-073448-a8a81dcc` reported 32.53 worker CPU-seconds
  and 369,868,800 peak worker bytes. These inline counters are preliminary;
  the A/B verdict will use matched finelog stage aggregates.
- Treatment wheel MinHash processed the identical 103,848 documents,
  2,700,048 buckets, and 32 truncations with 41.65 worker CPU-seconds and
  640,974,848 peak worker bytes. Its connected-components execution is
  `20260724-074353-8dc09291`.
- The first wheel smoke failed before reading data because the launcher was
  given the literal prefix `0.1b`, which contains no artifacts, instead of
  the immutable S3 testbed path. The corrected v3 smoke is
  `/rav/datakit-6854-ab-treatment-wheel-combined-smoke-v3-20260724`.
- Added an exhaustive audit pipeline that joins every marker to its normalized
  text and both arms' MinHash buckets, streams cluster members against their
  canonical, computes exact character- and word-5-gram Jaccard and
  containment, and emits an occurrence-level A/B comparison. It preserves
  source, shard, and ID references for full-text semantic review without
  copying the corpus.
- Added a structural report validator. Its first run correctly exposed a
  historical schema difference: the baseline report predates
  `transitive_members_kept` and omits that key. The validator now requires the
  historical baseline schema and the expanded treatment schema while enforcing
  exact document accounting for both.

### 2026-07-24T08:18:00Z — exhaustive 0.1B audit and semantic adjudication

- Treatment combined-layout smoke
  `/rav/datakit-6854-ab-treatment-wheel-combined-smoke-v3-20260724`
  succeeded over the same 115 sources and 103,848 documents. It emitted four
  members in two clusters: two canonicals, two documents to drop, one
  transitive member kept, and 103,843 singletons.
- `/rav/datakit-6854-treatment-report-validate-20260724` validated the full
  treatment report payload and HTML accounting: 115 sources, 103,848
  documents, four sampled members, two clusters, two drops, and one transitive
  member kept. The baseline report validator had already validated 13 sampled
  members, five clusters, and eight drops over the same input.
- The first audit attempt failed before emitting classifications because sparse
  sources use valid zero-row Parquet marker stubs with no columns. The corrected
  reader treats only zero-row files as empty and still requires `id` and
  `attributes` on non-empty files.
- `/rav/datakit-6854-dedup-audit-smoke-v2-20260724` succeeded and covered every
  marker: 13 baseline rows, four treatment rows, and 15 distinct occurrences.
  It found five baseline canonicals, eight baseline drops, two treatment
  canonicals, two treatment drops, seven baseline-drop/treatment-keep
  disagreements, one treatment-drop/baseline-keep disagreement, one shared
  drop, and six canonical-only occurrences. Baseline graph coverage was exact:
  five distance-0 canonicals, six direct distance-1 neighbors, and two
  distance-2 transitive members.
- Full-text semantic adjudication read every dropped document and its canonical:
  - All four baseline MASSIVE drops are false positives. Their shared payload
    is a function-schema catalog, but they contain different tool subsets,
    languages, requests, function names, arguments, and call IDs. Treatment
    keeps three but still drops the Spanish calendar example against a Latvian
    weather example; that shared treatment drop is also a false positive.
  - Both baseline Nemotron-code drops are false positives. One pairs distinct
    PHP manual pages (`MongoDB...getServer` versus `UI...isReadOnly`); the other
    pairs different PHP builds/environments. Treatment keeps all four.
  - The baseline StarCoder2 drop is a false positive: it removes a 1,876-line
    C++/LLVM document against a different 929-line program, including 938
    unique exact lines and a different source solution. Treatment keeps it.
  - The baseline Nemotron high-quality drop is a true positive: the 1,101-byte
    member is a literal truncated prefix of the 1,872-byte canonical. Treatment
    misses this pair.
  - The treatment-only Nemotron medium-quality drop is a true positive:
    both documents are the same low-quality template with entity slots
    substituted. Baseline misses this pair.
- On the union of smoke candidates, baseline therefore made seven false-positive
  drops and one true-positive drop; treatment made one false-positive and one
  true-positive drop. This is not a corpus-wide recall estimate because neither
  arm enumerates non-candidate pairs.
- Matched finelog statistics use exact root-job execution IDs. MinHash processed
  115 identical shard entries and 21,160 bytes: worker CPU fell from 102.35s to
  41.65s (-59.3%), while peak memory rose from 628,441,088 to 640,974,848 bytes.
  Summing the initial graph build, three CC iterations, and marker emission
  (deduplicating one identical repeated finelog END row) gives 240.46 baseline
  CPU-seconds versus 233.93 treatment CPU-seconds (-2.7%). Total MinHash plus
  dedup CPU was 342.81s versus 275.58s (-19.6%). Graph-stage item counts differ
  slightly because the graph semantics differ; only MinHash has identical work.

### 2026-07-24T08:31:00Z — full 100B A/B launched and MinHash complete

- Launched both non-preemptible full arms against the pinned 103,716,988-document
  inventory with identical resources and only the intended implementation
  difference:
  - baseline `/rav/datakit-6854-ab-baseline-100b-20260724`, submitted
    2026-07-24T08:18:53Z;
  - treatment `/rav/datakit-6854-ab-treatment-100b-20260724`, submitted within
    23 seconds of the baseline.
- Exact command shape for both arms:
  `uv run python experiments/datakit/scripts/dedup_ab_run.py run --variant
  <arm> --code-ref <pinned-sha> --max-workers 256 --dedup-parallelism 512
  --max-concurrent-sources 4 --layout combined`.
- Both MinHash stages completed all 768 input shards with identical accounting:
  103,716,988 documents, 2,696,641,688 buckets, 31,351 capped texts, and
  141,312 input-list bytes. Inline worker CPU was 84,007.55 seconds for
  baseline character 5-grams and 24,982.35 seconds for treatment word 5-grams
  (-70.3%). Peak aggregate worker memory was 3,859,361,792 versus
  3,819,208,704 bytes. Final performance claims will use the matched finelog
  records after all stages finish.
- The frequent best-effort endpoint-unregister and finelog send warnings during
  the 256-worker shutdown burst did not fail or preempt either job and did not
  change the exact output counters.
- Baseline combined and per-source smoke layouts are exactly equivalent:
  115 sources, 115 shards, 13 marker rows, and five canonical rows. Artifact:
  `s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/user/rav/datakit/dedup-ab/issue6854-layout-verification-20260724-v1/baseline.json`.
- The corrected audit invariant run additionally rejects duplicate marker IDs
  and requires strictly sorted normalized IDs. Its score and graph passes
  reproduced the prior smoke counts, including exact graph distances 0/1/2 =
  5/6/2. `/rav/datakit-6854-dedup-audit-smoke-v3-20260724` then completed
  successfully with all 15 distinct occurrences accounted for and the same
  seven baseline-only drops, one treatment-only drop, one shared drop, and six
  canonical-only occurrences.

### 2026-07-24T09:18:00Z — directional audit correction

- Rechecked the machine adjudication against every manual smoke label before
  scaling it to the full corpus. Shorter-side containment was unsound for a
  dropped member longer than its canonical: it would have called the
  1,876-line StarCoder member redundant even though it has 938 unique exact
  lines.
- The audit now records raw-text SHA-256 identity, canonical and member
  containment separately, which side is longer, cross-source pairs, and
  MinHash truncation on either side. Only byte-identical raw text is
  machine-confirmed as a duplicate. Very low bidirectional overlap is
  machine-confirmed as a false positive; all intermediate and normalized-only
  matches remain ambiguous for full-text semantic review.
- Six focused tests cover directionality, longer dropped members,
  normalized-text containment, raw identity, conservative false positives,
  and low-Jaccard one-sided containment. The corrected smoke score pass
  classified all eight baseline and both treatment drops as ambiguous,
  matching the need for the existing full-text labels and eliminating the
  prior false automatic duplicate label.
