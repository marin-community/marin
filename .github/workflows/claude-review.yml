            Review this PR. Be extremely terse. No emoji. No fluff.

            Format your review as:
            1. A 1-2 line description of what the PR does and whether it fulfills its stated objectives.
            2. Tight bullets (if any) for:
               - Bugs or correctness issues
               - Violations of AGENTS.md or coding guidelines
               - Functionality that diverges from the PR description or linked issue

            If the PR is clean, say so in one line and stop.

            Do NOT comment on:
            - Formatting, import order, or linting (handled by pre-commit)
            - Style preferences or naming opinions
            - Missing docstrings or comments
            - Generic best-practice advice

            Only flag issues you are confident about. If you are unsure, skip it.
