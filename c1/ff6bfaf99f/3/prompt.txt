instead of arg hash in @lib/marin/src/marin/execution/remote.py for the name, let's just get short uuid

---

don't create seaprate function for _short_uuid

---

change `DEFAULT_JOB_NAME` to "remote_job"

---

In the base_name let's include current user name

---

in @lib/marin/src/marin/execution/step_spec.py update to when name in remote is not specified, use name_with_hash and with additional short uuid

---

right but I want the stepspec to include the uuid by default

---

but only if the name is not already specified on the remote

---

run relevant tests

---

here's my description of the latest change:

```
* follow up to https://github.com/marin-community/marin/pull/3051
* if `name` is specified in `remote` don't change it
* if name is not specified, best effort to get base name + short uuid
  * I don't think arg hashing is worth the complexity, and if the user wants name lock, they can handle it 
* `StepSpec` uses the name with hash + short uuid

This way:
 * afaiu you can get name "lock" via explicit name 
 * restart of steps should just work 

```

scrutinize it

---

should we just do truthiness on both cases?

---

run tests

---

address the comment https://github.com/marin-community/marin/pull/3076#discussion_r2861487179

---

no I just want `named`, that optionally adds the name

---

split that single wrapped in stepspec into two line to readability

---

update the `named` docstring, to something more explicit: "Noop if already has name. Otherwise use provided name"
