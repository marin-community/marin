does harbor support mini-swe-agent v2 (the latest)?

---

yes

---

why would we worry about the trajectory format?

---

Ok then, what would it take to update exp2602_harbor_ot_tb_dev.py to support evaluating on https://huggingface.REDACTED, a random 100 task subset of sweb?

---

Would this version be more suitable? https://huggingface.co/datasets/DCAgent2/swebench-verified-random-100-folders

Can you give me an updated version of the command above to evaluate gs:REDACTED on the sweb 100 subset

---

I think you also need to specify the agent harness right?

---

mini-swe-agent v2

---

Can you look into lib/harbor? I thought src/harbor/agents/installed/install-mini-swe-agent.sh.j2 should already be using the pypi version

---

Revert this change. I thought we merged the latest harbor main a while back right? It should already contain this fix?

---

Can you just pull https://github.REDACTED.sh.j2 and check? It already uses pypi

---

Revert this patch, can you look into why that merge didn't include this change?

---

Could you undo that 'merge' and redo a proper merge that preserves the py311 patches but gets all the most up to date changes from upstream?
