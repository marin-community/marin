Dear Reader,

To think we'd be making it to international film festivals was not
something we'd have been able to tell you 2 years back! Favcy just had
its first brush with stardom and we're reeling with excitement.

Our portfolio startup *PayTamasha's* first film - **Ghaath** premiered
at the **Berlin International Film Festival**! The entire PayTamasha
team and our Founding Partner, *Pranav Chaturvedi* graced the red carpet
there, whaaat?! Read more about it in the ***Portfolio Startup Update***
section.

Talking about wins, have you seen TellerSpot yet? TellerSpot has been
winning over investors recently with it's unique exits-as-a-service
model that enables exits for startup investors. Read about it in the
***Current Open Deals*** section.

What's more? With tax season around the corner, we decided to decode
Angel Tax in the ***[Angel Bytes](/angel-tax-decoded)*** section.

Lastly, in the ***Future\@Favcy*** section, we've got open positions
here at Favcy in case you're looking to join our boat!

Cheers,

Ninie
