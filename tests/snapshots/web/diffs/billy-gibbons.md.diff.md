Billy Gibbons & Co., "Oh Well" - Song Review
============================================

No one will accuse Gibbons, Matt Sweeney and Blake Mills of being
intimidated by the already bluesy rock song. Their version is an
original, born from the mud of Mississippi Delta.

This new power trio stretch a two or three minute cut (original version)
to nearly five minutes of rootsy rambling with bare bones percussion and
organ garnish. Gibbons is a burly behemoth on vocals, which don't begin
until almost 90 seconds into the song.

"*I can't help about the shape I'm in / I can't sing, I ain't pretty and
my legs are thin*," Gibbons begins, commanding your attention like an
eight foot gorilla. "*But don't ask me what I think of you / I might not
give the answer that you want me to."*

The new version may not play well with [Fleetwood
Mac](//ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/fleetwood-mac/)'s most loyal fans,
as the legendary group rarely made music this dirty. Much of Gibbon's
singing is over little more than a cymbal click or hallow acoustic
guitar. The familiar riff that carries the song isn't muted, only slowed
down to allow one space to savor the other ingredients during the
extended jams. The song almost stops at 3:05.

"*Now, when I talked to God I knew he'd understand / He said stick by my
side and I'll be your guiding hand*," Gibbons begins again, growling the
title like "Oh Well" was one from his Texas twosome's catalog. Sweeney
has another cut on "Just Tell Me That You Want Me," available Aug.Â 14.
This song makes you want to hear it immediately.
