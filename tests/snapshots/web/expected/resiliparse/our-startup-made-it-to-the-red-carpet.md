# Our startup made it to the red carpet?!

Dear Reader,

To think we'd be making it to international film festivals was not something we'd have been able to tell you 2 years back! Favcy just had its first brush with stardom and we're reeling with excitement.

Our portfolio startup *PayTamasha's* first film - **Ghaath** premiered at the **Berlin International Film Festival**! The entire PayTamasha team and our Founding Partner, *Pranav Chaturvedi* graced the red carpet there, whaaat?! Read more about it in the ***Portfolio Startup Update*** section.

Talking about wins, have you seen TellerSpot yet? TellerSpot has been winning over investors recently with it's unique exits-as-a-service model that enables exits for startup investors. Read about it in the ***Current Open Deals*** section.

What's more? With tax season around the corner, we decided to decode Angel Tax in the ***[Angel Bytes](/angel-tax-decoded "")*** section.

Lastly, in the ***Future@Favcy*** section, we've got open positions here at Favcy in case you're looking to join our boat!

Cheers,

Ninie
