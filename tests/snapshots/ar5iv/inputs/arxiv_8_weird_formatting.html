<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Integral-field-spectroscopy and multi-object-spectroscopy provide
the high multiplex gain required for efficient use of the upcoming
generation of extremely large telescopes. We present instrument
developments and designs for both concepts, and how these designs
can be applied to cryogenic near-infrared instrumentation.
Specifically, the fiber-based concept stands out the possibility to
expand it to any number of image points, and its modularity predestines
it to become the new concept for multi-field-spectroscopy.
Which of the three concepts ‚Äî integral-field-, multi-object-, or
multi-field-spectroscopy ‚Äî is best suited for the largest telescopes
is discussed considering the size of the objects and their
density on the sky.</p>

Compared to current state of the art 10 m-class telescopes,
the biggest of those telescopes provide a collecting power roughly 100

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">First, and most straight forward, we will be able to carry out spectroscopy

astronomers have done during the last century, and at first sight seem
related only
to the collecting area of the telescopes. But since such observations
will be background limited, we will only gain a factor of 10 ‚Äî 2.5
magnitudes ‚Äî compared to the existing 10 m telescopes
for seeing limited observations of point sources.
Only adaptive optics assisted observations at the diffraction limit
of the telescopes will boost the limiting magnitude by a
factor of 100 ‚Äî 5 magnitudes ‚Äî when enlarging the mirror-size
from 10 m to 100 m.
High angular resolution capability therefore will be mandatory.</p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">And third, most exciting for us, is the prospect of exploring
the universe at angular scales of a few milliarcseconds, the diffraction
limit of such an Extremely Large Telescope. Like the Hubble Deep Field for
the faint object science, the direct imaging and spectroscopy
of planets can serve as the final goal for high angular resolution astronomy.
While imaging at this angular resolution will also be possible with
interferometric arrays like the VLT, only the collecting area of
several 1000 m<sup id="S1.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_sup">2</sup> will provide enough photons for spectroscopy.</p>

<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Since an Extremely Large Telescope will cost the order
of 1 billion US$, throughput of the instruments has highest priority.
Throughput in this context does not only mean
imperfect transmission and detection of the light, but specifically
multiplex-gain. For the faint-object-science, best throughput implies
simultaneous spectroscopy of as many objects as possible. This is
the standard domain of multi-object-spectroscopy. On the other hand,
if objects are to be resolved, and if we are interested in their
complex structure, integral-field-spectroscopy is the the first choice.
This technology is definitely required when observing with adaptive
optics at the diffraction limit of a telescope, both to avoid
imperfect slit-positioning on the object, and for post-observational
correction of the imperfect point-spread-function by means of deconvolution.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An integral-field-spectrograph obtains simultaneously the spectra
for a two-dimensional field with a single exposure.
It therefore distinguishes itself from several other ways of measuring
spectra for a two-dimensional field, which all need multiple integrations.
Well known and applied in astronomy for several decades
are (1) Fabry-Perot-imaging-spectroscopy, (2)
Fouriertransform-spectroscopy, (3) slit-scanning-spectroscopy. Why is
integral-field-spectroscopy most appropriate to ground-based
astronomy, especially at the highest angular resolution?</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Fabry-Perot-imaging-spectroscopy and Fouriertransform-spectroscopy
require repetitive integrations to obtain full spectra.
Therefore ground-based observations suffer a lot from varying atmospheric
conditions. Both atmospheric absorption and emission must be measured
in between two adjacent wavelength-settings, and since the
atmospheric properties vary on a time-scale of minutes at
near-infrared-wavelengths, long single exposures, and therefore high
quality spectra for faint objects are almost impossible to record with
wavelength scanning techniques.
The difference between integral-field-spectroscopy and slit-scanning is
in principle rather small, since both instruments provide roughly the same
number of image points and the same spectral sampling. But because
most astronomical targets are far from being slit-like,
almost all observations can gain a lot from a square field of view.</p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The basic idea of image-slicing with mirrors is rather simple:
A stack of tilted plane mirrors is placed in
the focal plane, and each mirror reflects the light from
the image in a different direction. At a distance at which the rays
from the different mirrors are clearly separated, a second set
of mirrors realigns the rays to form the long-slit (figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‚Ä£ 2.1. Integral-Field-Spectroscopy ‚Ä£ 2. Concepts for Integral-Field- and Multi-Object-Spectroscopy ‚Ä£ Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy with Extremely Large Telescopes: Integral-Field- versus Multi-Object-Instruments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>)
of a long-slit-spectrograph, which disperses the light along the rows of
the detector. This concept was successfully applied
in the 3D-instrument <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>,
a near-infrared integral-field-spectrometer
developed and operated by MPE, and will be
used for SPIFFI II, the adaptive-optics-assisted field-spectrometer for the
VLT-instrument SINFONI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> .
The disadvantage of this concept is that shadowing
at the steps of the first stack of mirrors leads to unavoidable light
losses. This shadowing effect increases with smaller mirrors and a larger
field of view. In order to have little light losses one
would like to have large mirrors in the first stack. Because this
increases the total slit-length, and therefore makes the
collimator of the spectrograph-optics uncomfortably big,
a compromise
has to be found. For SPIFFI II with its approximately 1000 spatial
pixels arranged
in 32 slitlets, we chose the width of each mirror of the
first stack to be
300 <math id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">Œº</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1.1">ùúá</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p4.1.m1.1c">\mu</annotation></semantics></math>m, which leads to a total slit-length of about 300 mm.
For these parameters the shadowing-effect cuts out about 11% of the
total light<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
The whole slicer for SPIFFI II will be fabricated from
Zerodur using classical polishing techniques.
Optical contacting of the individual mirrors will provide a monolithic
structure that is insensitive to changes in temperature.
With 3D we proved that the concept is feasible, and our recent
results from cool-downs of an engineering slicer to the temperature of liquid
nitrogen ensures operation in cryogenic instruments.
However, the concept will find its limitation for
much larger fields due to increased shadowing.
Other recent developments of mirror-slicers
derive from the basic design with plane mirrors, and take advantage
of curved mirrors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Such a concept avoids
part of the shadowing-effects and provides a smaller
‚Äùslit‚Äù, thereby simplifying the design of the spectrograph-optics.</p>

fibers have to be accurately positioned behind each lenslet and the image
quality of the lenslets has to be very good. One way to loosen the
constraints on the positioning accuracy and the optical quality of the
lenslets is to use a larger <math id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="A\Omega" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1a"><mrow id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml">A</mi><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml">‚Äã</mo><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml">Œ©</mi></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1b"><apply id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1"><times id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.1"></times><ci id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.2">ùê¥</ci><ci id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1.1.3">Œ©</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.SS1.p6.1.m1.1c">A\Omega</annotation></semantics></math> for the fiber, which in turn
increases the f-number of the spectrograph-camera and finally limits
the pixel-size, especially at extremely large telescopes.
For a cryogenic instrument the positioning of the fibers behind the
lenslets is another critical point, since differential thermal
contraction both complicates gluing of the lenslets and fibers, and
due to small displacements degrades the coupling efficiency.
For SPIFFI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> we therefore started the development of monolithic
lens-fiber-units (figure <a href="#S2.F2" title="Figure 2 ‚Ä£ 2.1. Integral-Field-Spectroscopy ‚Ä£ 2. Concepts for Integral-Field- and Multi-Object-Spectroscopy ‚Ä£ Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy with Extremely Large Telescopes: Integral-Field- versus Multi-Object-Instruments" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), each consisting of a
silica-fiber, that has been flared
and a spherical lens polished onto it <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. Even though individual
fiber-lens-units could be produced with an overall transmission of more
than 70 % ‚Äî including coupling efficiency, reflection losses
and intrinsic absorption ‚Äî, the technology is not yet optimized
for producing several 1000 fibers at reasonable cost.
Despite all the technical problems with the image-slicer based
on flared fibers, there are three main advantages of this concept over
its competitors: First, its possible extension to any number of fibers.
Second, this concept provides full flexibility in the arrangement of
the fibers (see section on multiple-field-spectroscopy).
Third, the flared fiber is insensitive to a change in temperature and
can be used at cryogenic temperatures.
The flared-fiber technology will be implemented in LUCIFER <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>,

<p id="S2.SS1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Like the fiber-solution, the third concept
for integral-field-spectroscopy is based on a micro-lens-array
in the image plane.
But instead of reimaging the pupil of the
individual lenses onto different fibers, the whole set of
micro-pupils is now fed into a spectrograph <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. With the
micro-pupils filling only a small fraction of the total field,
with a slight tilt in the dispersion direction the spectra on the
detector fill the unused detector area between the micro-pupils without
overlapping of the individual spectra. Compared to the fiber-based concept,
there is no additional loss of light due to the coupling of light into
the fiber. Also the technology of producing micro-lens-arrays
is now well established, and its application in cryogenic instruments
seems straight forward. But while both mirror- and
fiber-slicers can disperse the light all across the detector, the
spectra of the micro-pupils need to be truncated before they overlap
with the spectra of another micro-pupil. Therefore such instruments
can provide high spectral resolution only for a very limited
wavelength range.</p>

high optical throughput, since no additional optical element

<p id="S2.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The second concept of multi-object-spectroscopy is based on
fibers. While in previous instruments fibers had to be placed by hand,
nowadays robots arrange the fibers, like in the AAT 2dF <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
Depending on the image-scale and the f-number, the light is either
coupled directly into the fiber, or a lenslet is used to reimage
the telescope-pupil onto the fiber core. As the fiber-based
integral-field-unit,
such multi-object-spectrographs can be expanded to almost any
number of objects.</p>

<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">For the time being, no cryogenic multi-object-spectrograph
for the infrared wavelength range has been set into operation. For the
LUCIFER instrument for the LBT, however, possible realization of the
two concepts ‚Äî multi-slit and fiber-based ‚Äî in a cryogenic
instrument are under study: In a multi-slit-spectrograph, the
technical key-problem is that the slit-masks have to be produced ‚Äùoff-line‚Äù,
and need to be inserted into the cryogenic system. One possibility
would be an air-lock through which a set of slit-masks are fed into a
juke-box and cooled down to the temperature of liquid
nitrogen, before they are actually moved into the field.
A fiber-based system, however, will require a fully cryogenic
robot to position the fibers. But unlike their optical counterparts,
present-day fibers for the infrared are either rather fragile
(zirconiumflouride), or show significant extinction towards longer
wavelengths (waterfree
silica). Therefore long fibers and big movements should be avoided,
and a ‚ÄùSpaltspinne‚Äù-like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> mount of the fibers with a
long-slit-spectrograph located directly behind seems most

Of the three concepts described above ‚Äî mirror-slicer,
fiber-slicer, micro-pupil-array ‚Äî, the mirror-slicer provides the most
efficient use of detector elements, because it is the only technology
that actually uses almost all pixels. Being not yet at its
limitation in field-coverage, this concept may be the choice for the next
generation of instruments. In the more distant future, when
detector-size and -availability will not limit our

the most expandable fiber-concept are most appropriate.</p>

telescope time, multi-object spectroscopy will be one of the most
important operation modes for extremely large telescopes. But with the
pixel-size of a few milliarcseconds, the problem of accurate
