## Abstract

We present a thermodynamics argument against a strictly linear temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth, which applies to superconductors with arbitrary pairing symmetry at low temperatures.

Some evidence for an unconventional $`d_{x^2ây^2}â`$pairing symmetry in cuprate high$`âT_{câ\text{Â }}`$superconductors is provided by recent angle resolved photoemission experiments\[1\]. A striking proof for the $`d_{x^2ây^2}â`$symmetry of the Cooper pairs in cuprates arises from the observation of a spontanously generated half flux quantum in Josephson tunneling experiments carried out on tetracrystal substrates\[2\]. Early support for the possibility of a $`d_{x^2ây^2}â`$symmetry of the Cooper pairs in cuprate high$`âT_{câ\text{Â }}`$superconductors came from the observation of a linear $`Tâ`$dependence of the magnetic penetration depth \[3\],\[4\] at low temperatures $`T`$:

$$\mathrm{Î»}â(T)â\mathrm{Î»}â(0)â¼T$$

command somewhere after the documentstyle command Such a linear $`Tâ`$dependence of the magnetic penetration depth (MPD) has a topological origin. If the order parameter associated with the Cooper pair condensate vanishes along node lines on the Fermi surface the spectrum $`N_sâ(E)`$ of quasiparticle excitations in the superconducting phase is gapless and varies proportional to $`E`$ at low excitation energies: $`N_sâ(E)â¼E`$ for $`Eâª\mathrm{Î}_{\mathrm{max}}`$ . For this reason a pure $`d_{x^2ây^2}â`$pairing state (node lines along $`k_x=Â\pm k_y`$) should display a strictly linear dependence of MPD vs. $`T`$ at low temperatures. In previous work this effect was also discussed for the polar phase in a triplet pairing superconductor, e.g. \[5\].

New experiments\[6\] indicate deviations from this linearity of MPD with temperature, for example a $`T^2`$-dependence of MPD below some cross over temperature $`T^{â}`$ was measured. Such a behaviour may occur due to various reasons. For example, I. Kosztin and A.J. Leggett \[7\] explaine this behavior in terms of nonlocal electrodynamics. Their argument is, that in clean $`d_{x^2ây^2}â`$pairing superconductors there exist surface induced non local effects, which lead to a $`T^2`$-dependence of $`\mathrm{Î»}_{aâb}â(T)â\mathrm{Î»}_{aâb}â(0)`$, as extracted from optical and microwave experiments with the magnetic field orientated parallel to the $`\widehat{c}â`$ direction. On the other hand, in experiments with the magnetic field orientated perpendicular to the $`\widehat{c}â`$ direction the $`T`$-dependence of MPD cannot be altered by the Kosztin-Leggett effect.

Since the Kosztin-Leggett effect \[7\] really depends on the existence of a surface in the problem it cannot be applied to other measurement techniques of MPD, for example direct static magnetic measurements, measurements of vortex properties, the lower critical magnetic field $`B_{câ1}`$, muon spin relaxation. Such techniques of measuring MPD have bulk character.

In the following we present a proof, for arbitrary superconductors, that a strictly linear $`Tâ`$dependence of MPD at low temperatures violates the third law of thermodynamics. For simplicity let us consider a uniform system where all properties depend on coordinates $`\mathrm{ð«}â\mathrm{ð«}^{â²}`$ only. The current-current correlator,

$$\mathrm{Î·}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})=k^2â\frac{\mathrm{Ï}^2}{c^2}â\mathrm{Î\mu }_{târ}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})$$
(2)   
connects the vector potential $`\mathrm{ð}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})`$ to the external current $`\mathrm{ð\pounds }_{eâxât}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})`$ via

$$\mathrm{Î·}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})â\mathrm{ð}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})=\frac{4â\mathrm{Ï}}{c}â\mathrm{ð\pounds }_{eâxât}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})$$
(3)   
In turn, the transversal dielectric function, $`\mathrm{Î\mu }_{târ}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})`$, is related to the electromagnetic kernel $`Qâ(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})`$ by the relation

$$\mathrm{Î\mu }_{târ}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})=1â\frac{4â\mathrm{Ï}âQâ(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})}{\mathrm{Ï}^2}$$
(4)   
The definition of the operator of inverse MPD is then

$$\frac{1}{\mathrm{Î»}^2â(\mathrm{ð¤},T)}=\underset{\mathrm{Ï}â0}{lim}\frac{\mathrm{Ï}^2}{c^2}â\{1âRe\mathrm{Î\mu }_{târ}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï})\}â¡\frac{4â\mathrm{Ï}}{c^2}âQâ(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï}=0)$$
(5)   
In the static case the additional free energy in the presence of an externaly controlled current distribution Â $`\mathrm{ð\pounds }_{eâxât}â(\mathrm{ð¤})`$ (we use a transversal gauge) can be written in the form \[8\]:

$`\mathrm{â\pm }`$ $`=`$ $`â{\displaystyle \frac{1}{2âc}}â{\displaystyle â«\frac{d^3âk}{(2â\mathrm{Ï})^3}â\mathrm{ð\pounds }_{eâxât}â(\mathrm{ð¤})â\mathrm{ð}â(â\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï}=0)}`$ (6)   
$`=`$ $`â{\displaystyle \frac{1}{8â\mathrm{Ï}}}â{\displaystyle â«\frac{d^3âk}{(2â\mathrm{Ï})^3}â\mathrm{Î·}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï}=0)â|\mathrm{ð}â(\mathrm{ð¤},\mathrm{Ï}=0)|^2}`$ (7)   
By using these relations and Maxwellâs equations it follows

$$\mathrm{â\pm }=â\frac{1}{8â\mathrm{Ï}}ââ«\frac{d^3âk}{(2â\mathrm{Ï})^3}â\left[k^2+\frac{1}{\mathrm{Î»}^2â(\mathrm{ð¤},T)}\right]â\frac{|\mathrm{ð¤}Ã\mathrm{ð}â(\mathrm{ð¤};T)|^2}{k^4}$$
(8)   
Here $`\mathrm{ð}â(\mathrm{ð¤},T)`$ is the (temperature dependent) induced magnetic field and satisfies the equation:

$$\left[k^2+\frac{1}{\mathrm{Î»}^2â(\mathrm{ð¤},T)}\right]â\mathrm{ð}â(\mathrm{ð¤};T)=\frac{4â\mathrm{Ï}}{c}âiâ\mathrm{ð¤}Ã\mathrm{ð\pounds }_{eâxât}â(\mathrm{ð¤})$$
(9)   
Differentiating Eq.(8) with respect to temperature $`T`$ and calculating the derivative $`\frac{â}{âT}â\mathrm{ð}â(\mathrm{ð¤};T)`$ from Eq.(9) we get an expression for the entropy:

$$Sâ\left(T\right)=â\frac{â\mathrm{â\pm }}{âT}=â\frac{1}{8â\mathrm{Ï}}ââ«\frac{d^3âk}{(2â\mathrm{Ï})^3}â\frac{â}{âT}â\left[\frac{1}{\mathrm{Î»}^2â(\mathrm{ð¤},T)}\right]â\frac{|\mathrm{ð}â(\mathrm{ð¤};T)|^2}{k^2}$$
(10)   
According to the Nernst principle (third law of thermodynamics) the entropy should vanish in the limit $`Tâ0`$. From the positivity of the integrand we must conclude

$$\underset{Tâ0}{lim}\frac{â\mathrm{Î»}â(\mathrm{ð¤},T)}{âT}=0$$
(11)   
If we wish to avoid a violation of the third law of thermodynamics the $`Tâ`$dependence of the magnetic penetration depth in a superconductor cannot be of the form $`\mathrm{Î»}â(T)â\mathrm{Î»}â(0)â¼T^n`$ with $`n=1`$. The argument can be extended to any nonuniform system.

We see that the vanishing of the first derivative of MPD for $`Tâ0`$ is a consequence of a general principle of thermodynamics. The value of $`T^{â}`$ below which a deviation of the linear $`Tâ`$dependence of MPD may be observed depends on the exact physical mechanism. It may be nonlocality\[7\], it may be the effect of impurities (as proposed in Ref.\[9\]), it may be also the effect of collective excitations (e.g. the influence of vertex corrections on the $`Tâ`$dependence of MPD was discussed in Ref.\[10\] for the case of pure $`sâ`$wave pairing).

A famous reformulation of the third law of thermodynamics states that it is impossible to reach absolute zero. From this point of view a pure $`d_{x^2ây^2}â`$pairing symmetry in clean high-$`T_c`$ superconductors becomes, perhaps, invalid for $`Tâ0`$. A possibility to avoid the paradox of a linear $`T`$-dependence of MPD for $`Tâ0`$ in cuprate superconductors is a phase transition ( at a temperature $`T_{câ2}`$ much lower than the transition temperature $`T_c`$) to a new unconventional pairing state without nodes on the Fermi surface\[11\], \[12\].
