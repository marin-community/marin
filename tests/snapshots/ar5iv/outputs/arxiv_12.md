# Astrometric Resolution of Severely Degenerate Binary Microlensing Events

## 1 Introduction

Caustic-crossing binary microlensing events are potentially very useful, but their interpretation can be problematic. If there is good photometric coverage of a caustic crossing, one can measure the limb darkening of the source (Albrow et al. 1999b; Afonso et al. 2000; Albrow et al. 2000), and if this is combined with spectroscopy, one can resolve the source’s spectral features as a function of angular position (Gaudi & Gould 1999). If there is sufficiently good coverage of the event to obtain a unique binary solution, then one determines the binary mass ratio and in some cases other information about the binary (Albrow et al. 2000). If this information can be obtained for a number of events, then one can infer statistical properties about the binaries in the lens population as a whole (Gaudi & Sackett 2000).

In some cases, it is possible to measure the proper motion $`\mu `$ of the lens relative to the observer-source line of sight. This requires three pieces of information from the photometric light curve. First, one must measure the time it takes the source star to cross the caustic, $`\mathrm{\Delta }t`$ which can be done from photometry of the caustic-crossing alone (e.g. Albrow et al. 1999a,c). Second, one must measure the angle $`\varphi `$ of this crossing, which requires a unique binary solution for the event as a whole. Third, one must determine the angular size $`\theta _{}`$ of the source from its color and apparent magnitude using an empirically calibrated relation (van Belle 1999). The color is quite easily measured but the apparent magnitude again requires a unique binary solution. The proper motion is then $`\mu =\theta _{}/(\mathrm{\Delta }t|\mathrm{sin}\varphi |)`$. Five groups (Afonso et al. 1998; Udalski et al. 1998; Alcock et al. 1999; Albrow et al. 1999; Rhie et al. 1999) combined observations from 8 observatories to measure the proper motion of MACHO 98-SMC-1 and so proved beyond reasonable doubt that the lens was in the SMC and not in the Galactic halo (Afonso et al. 2000).

As can be seen from this brief summary, many applications of binary lenses require that one obtain a unique binary-lens solution to the event. However, Dominik (1999a) presented multiple solutions to a number previously published events and argued that degeneracies of this sort may be generic.

Han, Chun, & Chang (1999) therefore investigated whether such degeneracies can be broken astrometrically. In a binary lensing event there are three or five images depending on whether the source is outside or inside the caustic. The combined light of these three or five images makes up the photometric light curve which is the only effect that has been observed to date. The images are separated by of order the Einstein radius, $`\theta _\mathrm{E}`$ which is a few hundred $`\mu `$as for typical events. Hence, the images cannot be separately resolved with any existing or planned instrument. However, the image centroid deviates from the source position by a vector amount $`\delta \theta \theta _c=(\delta \theta _{c,x},\delta \theta _{c,y})`$ which is also of order $`\theta _\mathrm{E}`$. The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) with its planned $`4\mu `$as precision will therefore have the capability to measure this deviation, and several ground-based interferometers may also achieve the necessary precision.

Han et al. (1999) explicitly showed that the four solutions that Dominik (1999a) presented for OGLE-7 (Udalski et al. 1994), which all fit the observed light curve extremely well, had radically different astrometric trajectories. Hence, had there been astrometric data, this degeneracy could have easily been broken.

Subsequently, Albrow et al. (1999c) developed a general method for finding solutions in events with well-covered caustic crossings, and Afonso et al. (2000) applied this method to MACHO 98-SMC-1 and found two solutions that fit the full data set equally well. See Figures 1 and 2, below. In spite of Dominik’s (1999a) work showing that degeneracies in earlier light curves were common, the degeneracy in MACHO 98-SMC-1 came as something of a surprise because the 5-collaboration data set was far superior to those of the events investigated by Dominik (1999a).

However, simultaneously with Afonso et al.’s (2000) empirical discovery of a severe degeneracy in MACHO 98-SMC-1, Dominik (1999b) found an entire class of severe degeneracies between “close” and “wide” binaries, i.e., binaries with projected angular separations small and large compared to $`\theta _\mathrm{E}`$. Indeed, MACHO 98-SMC-1 turns out to be a particular case of this class.

The disturbing thing about the Dominik (1999b) close/wide degeneracies, and what makes them so difficult to break, is that they derive from a degeneracy in the lens equation itself. That is, while some of the degeneracies found by Dominik (1999a) may be regarded as due “accidental” similarities between different light curves (the sum of the magnification of the three or five images), the close/wide degeneracies are rooted in the similarities of the individual images. This immediately raises the question of whether it is possible to break these degeneracies at all, even using astrometric data as Han et al. (1999) showed could be done for the earlier (Dominik 1999a) degeneracies. We address that question here.

## 2 Astrometric Resolution

To investigate this question, we examine the astrometric behavior of the two solutions<sup>1</sup><sup>1</sup>1Afonso et al. (2000) actually found two wide solutions, a static and a rotating one. The static solution was completely consistent with the data in the neighborhood of the observable event, but was by chance ruled out by early data about 500 days before the event. For simplicity, and because we are trying to illustrate a general principle rather than specifically investigate MACHO 98-SMC-1, we will use the static wide solution and therefore will ignore the early data. This will allow us to compare two static systems, thus ensuring that differences between the astrometric trajectories are not due to the fact that one is rotating and the other is not. to MACHO 98-SMC-1 found by Afonso et al. (2000). The Einstein radii $`\theta _\mathrm{E}`$ are $`74\mu `$as and $`167\mu `$as, the Einstein crossing times $`t_\mathrm{E}`$ are 99 days and 165 days, the mass ratios $`M_2/M_1`$ are 0.50 and 4.17, and the separations are $`d\theta _\mathrm{E}`$ where $`d=0.54`$ and $`3.25`$. Here $`M_1`$ is the mass of the component that is closer to the caustic that the source passes through. The full solutions are described in Tables 1 and 2 of Afonso et al. (2000).

Figure 1 shows the trajectory of the source relative to the binary in the two solutions. Figure 2 is adapted from Figures 3 and 4 of Afonso et al. (2000) and shows the predicted light curves in $`I`$ band for these two solutions. Time is shown as HJD=HJD-2450000. The data are binned in 1-day intervals except in the immediate neighborhood of the caustics where there are 0.1-day bins. Data taken in other bands are adjusted to the $`I`$ band system using the source and background fluxes from each observatory and each band as determined from the overall fit. See Afonso et al. (2000). The main conclusion from Figure 2 is that the two solutions are essentially identical from a photometric standpoint.

Figure 3 shows the astrometric deviation of the light centroid from the source position for the close and wide solutions, respectively. The dashed portions of the curve show the jumps at the times of the caustic crossings. These jumps would be discontinuous for a point source, but in fact take place by a (rapid) continuous motion for a finite source. Note that the two displacement curves look extremely similar. This similarity derives from the underlying degeneracy in the lens equation that was discovered by Dominik (1999b).

Although the pattern of centroid motion is extremely similar in the two cases, the two curves are actually displaced from one another by an offset

$$\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c(t)=\delta \theta \theta _{c,\mathrm{close}}(t)\delta \theta \theta _{c,\mathrm{wide}}(t),$$
(1)   
which is about $`40\mu `$as, i.e., $`0.5\theta _\mathrm{E}`$ for the close binary or by $`0.25\theta _\mathrm{E}`$ for the wide binary. Such an offset is not observable if the observations are restricted to times when $`\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c`$ is approximately constant. However, at very early or very late times, $`\delta \theta \theta _c0`$, since when the source is far from the lens, the image and source positions coincide. Because this occurs for both models, $`\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c`$ must vanish at these times. How long, in practice, must one wait to tell the difference between the two models?

This question is addressed in Figure 4 where we plot the offset between the two models, $`\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c(t)`$ as a function of time. The main figure shows the behavior of $`\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c(t)`$ over the whole event, while the inset is restricted to times during and after the caustic crossing (when in practice astrometric observations might first be triggered). The offset shows some structure on scales of $`5\mu `$as during the time when the source is inside the caustic, but the main thing to notice is that over the next year it changes by $`20\mu `$as and thus would be noticed if the event were monitored with SIM-like precision. The full $`40\mu `$as change would take place only after about a decade. Note that to the extent that $`d\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c/dt`$ can be approximated as a constant, $`\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c`$ cannot be detected at all, because such uniform motion can be subsumed in the fit for the proper motion of the source. However, from Figure 4, $`\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c(t)`$ slows down dramatically after about 1 year, so that after 2 years, its non-uniform motion could be unambiguously distinguished from uniform source motion.

It is also instructive to look at the behavior of Figure 4 at early times. Of course no astrometric measurements could have been taken then because there had been no signature of an event. However, the entire event could have just as well taken place in reverse. In this case post-caustic astrometric measurements would probe dramatic changes in the offset, much larger than the $`40\mu `$as changes in the event proceeding in its actual direction. The reason for this can be seen in Figure 1: the source passes relatively close to the companion binary member and this passage induces a large astrometric deviation. (Indeed, this passage is so close that it induces a noticeable deviation in the photometric light curve which is why the early data for this event ruled out the static wide solution.) In general, the source is not likely to pass close to both members, so that deviations of the type seen in Figure 4 are unlikely.

However, the $`40\mu `$as offset seen in Figure 3 at times when the source is inside the caustic is a generic feature of this caustic and does not depend in any way on the direction of the source trajectory through the caustic. Therefore, it is generically possible to break the close/wide (Dominik 1999b) degeneracy astrometrically, even when it is extremely difficult to do so photometrically.

## 3 Discussion

As a practical matter, SIM could not resolve the degeneracy in MACHO 98-SMC-1 because the source is only $`I22`$, far too faint for SIM to follow. Most events that SIM could monitor would be in the bulge where there are far more events and where the sources are much brighter. For these events, the typical Einstein radius is probably $`\theta _\mathrm{E}300\mu `$as, so the astrometric deviations would be several times larger than for MACHO 98-SMC-1. Hence, it seems likely that for sources that could be monitored astrometrically at all, breaking the degeneracy would be well within SIM’s capabilities.

Finally, we ask: what is the fundamental physical reason that the photometric degeneracy is reproduced as an astrometric degeneracy in the neighborhood of the caustic, but can be broken astrometrically at late times? This can most easily be seen by looking at Figure 1. In each model, the caustic that is crossed is associated with the mass at the right. The Einstein crossing times associated with these masses, $`t_\mathrm{E}^{}=[M_1/(M_1+M_2)]^{1/2}t_\mathrm{E}`$, are about the same in the two cases, $`t_{\mathrm{E},\mathrm{close}}^{}=81`$days and $`t_{\mathrm{E},\mathrm{wide}}^{}=72`$days, respectively. We therefore show the size of mass $`M_1`$ to be $`t_{\mathrm{E},\mathrm{close}}^{}/t_{\mathrm{E},\mathrm{wide}}^{}=1.25`$ times larger in the close-binary panel than in the wide-binary panel. The lens equation is very similar in the neighborhood of this mass, which is the origin of both the photometric and astrometric degeneracy. However, for the wide-binary solution, the very large mass of the companion at the left displaces the entire image structure to the right by $`[M_2/(M_1+M_2)]^{1/2}\theta _\mathrm{E}/d57\mu `$as. This displacement only gradually returns to zero: even at time $`dt_\mathrm{E}540`$days after the event, it has only fallen by half. By contrast, once the source has left the vicinity of $`M_1`$ of the close binary, there are no large and distant masses that could significantly displace the images relative to the source.

Figure 1: Positions of the components of the binary lens MACHO 98-SMC-1 in the two models of Afonso et al. (2000). The size (area) of the dots indicates the relative masses of the components. The panels show angular position scaled by the proper motion $`\mu `$. The units are therefore time which means that the source trajectory is shown as a function of $`\mathrm{\Delta }\theta _x/\mu +t_0=`$ HJD, and is therefore the same in the two panels.

Figure 2: Light curves for close binary (solid) and wide binary (dashed) models for the caustic-crossing binary microlensing event MACHO 98-SMC-1, together with binned data from 5 microlensing collaborations. Both the curves and data are adapted from Figures 3 and 4 of Afonso et al. (2000). The non-$`I`$ points have been put on the $`I`$ band system using the solutions of Afonso et al. (2000) so that both curves could be shown on the same plot. The two models predict virtually identical photometric results.

Figure 3: Astrometric deviation $`\delta \theta \theta _c`$ of the image centroid from the source position for the same two models shown in Figure 2 and over the same time interval, $`960\mathrm{HJD}^{}995`$. The crosses show the progress of the event in 1 day intervals, and the arrows designate the direction of the centroid motion. The dashed lines show the “instantaneous jumps” that the image centroid of a point source would undergo at the caustic crossing. Finite source effects (not shown) would make these transitions continuous and would fore-shorten them by about 3%. The arcs at the bottoms represent the image centroid positions when the source is inside the caustic. The pattern of motion in the two cases looks extremely similar, confirming the photometric degeneracy illustrated in Figure 2. However, the two trajectories are offset by $`40\mu `$as, meaning that they can be distinguished if the zero-point of astrometry is established by sufficiently late-time observations.

Figure 4: Difference $`\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c`$ between the two astrometric deviations shown in Figure 3, with evaluations every 100 days shown by crosses. The full figure shows $`\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c`$ over a period of 20 years, while the inset shows only the period during and after the caustic crossing (when astrometric measurements might reasonably have been triggered). During the year after the caustic crossing, $`\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c`$ changes by $`20\mu `$as. To the extent that this is consistent with uniform motion, it could not be disentangled from the uniform proper motion of the source. However, during the subsequent year, $`\mathrm{\Delta }\delta \theta \theta _c`$ slows down substantially, so that its motion over 2 years could easily be distinguished from uniform motion. Thus, astrometric measurements would distinguish between the two solutions.
