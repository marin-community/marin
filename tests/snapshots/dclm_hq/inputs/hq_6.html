	This post is a long one; I would encourage replies to be<br>
broken up into manageable subjects such as fonts, etc.<br>
	The following thoughts revolve around creating a simple<br>
yet powerful style sheet language for the World-Wide Web. I have<br>
incorporated comments here and there from a previous email<br>
discussion involving Hakon Lie, Dave Raggett, Dan Connolly, and<br>
Bill Perry. Hakon should feel free to put this post under the<br>
style sheet area at the W3O site.<br>
	A W3 style-sheet mailing list will likely be created,<br>
but Hakon says this will take some days. There should be pointers<br>
at <a href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</a> in time. In the meantime you can refer to:<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/archives.html">http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/archives.html</a><br>
<p>
	If you're not familiar with style sheets, please take<br>
a look at:<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Style/">http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Style/</a><br>
<p>
	...and take a look at the current proposals and ideas out<br>
there.<br>
	The format I discuss below is a bit different and somewhat<br>
improved over Hakon's format as described at the Chicago conference:<br>

<p>
	...but from the examples below it should be fairly easy<br>
to figure things out.<br>
	Finally, a few seconds of silence for the NSFNET backbone<br>
service, which was decommissioned yesterday, April 30, 1995.<br>
	May it rest in peace,<br>

Thinking About Style Sheets<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
Hakon Lie described a simple yet powerful style sheet format in<br>
Darmstadt, one which he has been working on for some time and had<br>
been greatly improved since its first rollout in Chicago. Despite<br>
that fact that it has not been formally described anywhere, I feel<br>
that the format is superior to the other proposed formats for a number<br>
of reasons:<br>
<p>
	1) It's simple yet flexible.<br>
<p>
	Many proposed formats are much too complex for their own<br>
	good - in order to read the simplest formatting commands,<br>
	browsers have to parse ornate structures and operations<br>
	which add little to the overall utility of the format.<br>
	Hakon's format is broken into manageable, logical chunks<br>
	that allow for extensibility and ease of parsing. The<br>
	format is also well-suited to be written in a compact format<br>
	that keeps the style sheet size to a minimum.<br>
<p>
	2) It's human readable and writeable.<br>
<p>
	The Web no longer belongs to the average Internet-savvy<br>
	technician who writes daily in Perl and C++. In order to<br>
	urge authors and designers to make use of style sheets<br>
	the format must be understandable so that one can "look<br>
	under the hood" when needed. Certainly tools and editors<br>
	will be created that makes style sheet creation easy,<br>
	but the Web will be rewarded a hundredfold by using a<br>
	format for which it is easy to create tools for.<br>
<p>
Below I propose a number of changes and additions to Hakon's format,<br>
using the time-tested lessons learned by the most popular DTP<br>
software packages on the market today as well as a little Web design<br>
experience. I feel that style sheets have the potential to revolutionize<br>
the way people use and think about the Web and hope that the standards<br>
process does the right thing both for users and authors.<br>
<p>
Note that many of the examples below will replace the need for using<br>
tag attributes and nonstandard HTML extensions to create layout. This<br>
is a good thing, as the layout/style will finally be separated more<br>
cleanly from the document structure.<br>
<p>
The idea, if I understand correctly, is:<br>
<p>
	&lt;HTML&gt;<br>
	&lt;STYLE NOTATION="experimental"&gt;<br>
<p>
	&lt;!-- The style sheet (or perhaps a pointer to it) goes here. --&gt;<br>
	&lt;!-- Here I can define a particular style, or rather, a CLASS. --&gt;<br>
<p>
	P[mystyle] : font.size = 12pt<br>
<p>
	&lt;/STYLE&gt;<br>
	&lt;BODY&gt;<br>
	Regular structured markup goes here.<br>
<p>
	&lt;P CLASS="mystyle"&gt;This is a paragraph in my style,<br>
	with a font size of 12 points.<br>
	&lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
	&lt;/HTML&gt;<br>
<p>
If you find this pretty easy to understand, well, that's the idea.<br>
Browsers may very well support DTDs as well as a readable style sheet<br>
format like Hakon's.<br>
<p>
Linked style sheets will announce themselves to browsers with a MIME<br>
type such as:<br>
<p>
	application/x-perry-stylesheet<br>
	application/x-arena-stylesheet<br>
	application/x-w3c-experimental<br>
	application/x-dsssl-lite<br>
<p>
New Things<br>
~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
I would say that authors should have the capability to include<br>
style sheets within the document as well as point to particular<br>
style sheets (that is, link to them). This makes it easy for a site<br>
to have a directory of "house" style sheets that apply to all documents<br>
in a particular web.<br>
<p>
First, there should be a way to specify data that applies to all tags,<br>
or data that applies to entire style sheet or class of objects. This<br>
may be done with wildcards:<br>
<p>
	BODY	: *.color = red<br>
	doc	: *.color = red<br>
	*	: font.size = 12pt<br>
<p>
"doc" is something representing the entire document. Most likely<br>
this should be replaced with HTML, as one may want different<br>
properties for HEAD and BODY.<br>
<p>
Apparently Hakon's notation allows for pattern matching on<br>
sequences of tags, hierarchies of tags, and attribute values.<br>
<p>
	HTML	: *.color = red<br>
<p>
In the second example, the font size of 12 points applies to the data in<br>
all tags. In the first example, the color of all elements in the BODY<br>
tag are red.<br>
<p>
In regards to sizes and such, there should be a way to specify a<br>
base size and then allow other styles to be sized relative to the<br>
base size.<br>
<p>
	H1	: font.size += 3pt<br>
	H1	: font.size = P[mystyle]:font.size + 10pt<br>
	H1	: font.size = 1.5 * P:font.size<br>
<p>
There should be a full listing and study of the proposed format<br>
name hierarchy, so that attributes are named in a logical, structured<br>
manner. More general objects should be on the left, with values becoming<br>
more specific to the right. So "color.background" should instead<br>
be "background.color", because background is a general object, while<br>
color is a specific property.<br>
<p>
Style sheets should support the most common units in DTP; these may be:<br>
<p>
	inches (in)<br>
	pixels (px)<br>
	centimeters/millimeters (cm/mm)<br>
	ems (em)<br>
	points (pt)<br>
	characters(ch)<br>
	pica(pi) - "pi" is equal to 12pt<br>
<p>
The characters unit is needed because a designer may wish to specify<br>
an indent or tab stop by the number of characters in the current font,<br>
for instance, in a PRE tag.<br>
<p>
All elements that support values should support a value of "default".<br>
Browsers would come out of the box with a default style sheet preselected<br>
that the user never need change if they don't want to.<br>
<p>
One possible way to specify tab stops might be:<br>
<p>
	PRE	: tabs = 8ch, 16ch, 24ch<br>
<p>
Dave Raggett notes that this is discouraged, as HTML 3.0 includes<br>
a TAB element that does many nice things.<br>
<p>
It would be useful to allow a number of format "shortcuts" so that people<br>
writing sheets manually don't have to type so much and so that the size<br>
of the style sheet stays at a minimum. One possible thing to do is to<br>
use the semicolon (is there a more appropriate character?) for allowing<br>
the designer to specify multiple values for multiple tags:<br>
<p>
	P H1     : font.color = red; blue<br>
	H1 H2 LI : font.size = 1.0; 0.8; 0.2<br>
<p>
In the first example, data in P tags would be red; data in H1 tags<br>
would be blue.<br>
<p>
In the second, the font size in H1 is the normal default size, H2<br>
has a font size of 0.8 times that, and LI has a font size of 0.2<br>
times that.<br>
<p>
Bill Perry suggests another kind of shortcut:<br>
<p>
	H1	: font.size=12pt; background.color = red;<br>
		  foreground.color = blue<br>
<p>
This is very nice, as authors can deal with a whole tag at a time on<br>
one line or split things up over multiple lines so the organization<br>
makes more sense. Again, this is for human usability.<br>
<p>
Another kind of shortcut is to provide shorter versions of<br>
words:<br>
<p>
	"img" for "image"<br>
	"bg" for "background"<br>
<p>
	H1	: bg.color = blue<br>
<p>
In specifying color, the designer should be able to enter the<br>
decimal/percentage values using the RGB color space, since it is more<br>
understandable and most image processing programs use these values:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.color = 191, 191, 191<br>
	P	: font.color = 0.75, 0.75, 0.75<br>
<p>
The percentages are percents of the range from 0 to 255. In the<br>
3D world, the range would be from 0 to 1, but we're not dealing with<br>
that context (yet).<br>
<p>
It would also be nice if one could define style-sheet specific color<br>
labels so that colors could be referred to by name rather than by number:<br>
<p>
	define "My Gray" "191, 191, 191"<br>
	P	: font.color = "My Gray"<br>
<p>
The use of such pre-processor-like definitions could be considered a<br>
good thing, since it again reduces the style sheet size and makes<br>
readability easier. For colors, as an example, one may be able to<br>
specify the color name as given in the X11 rgb database.<br>
<p>
It may be useful to allow the designer to provide hints about the<br>
document dimensions, but it is unclear as to where and how such metadata<br>
might be specified. Perhaps:<br>
<p>
	HTML	: width = 600px<br>
	HTML	: height = 800px<br>
<p>
Some browsers have a widget that when selected sizes the window to<br>
the widest non-textual element on the screen. I think the browser<br>
should resize itself automatically according to these hints if the user<br>
wants.<br>
<p>
Alignment and Justification<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
Alignment should refer to vertical movement, as in the IMG tag, while<br>
justification should be used to specify horizontal movement. Thus:<br>
<p>
	align may be top, middle, bottom, basetop, basemiddle, basebottom<br>
	justify may be left, right, center, full<br>
<p>
	IMG	: align = basetop<br>
	P	: justify = center<br>
<p>
Top, middle, and bottom align elements relative to the size of the<br>
highest character on the current line, measured from the baseline.<br>
<p>
Dave Raggett comments that HTML has got it wrong in this respect, with<br>
ALIGN being used for vertical and horizontal alignment. I say that although<br>
it's probably too late to change things in HTML, let's get it right in<br>
style sheets.<br>
<p>
Dave also says that one needs bleedleft, bleedright, and bleedboth<br>
additionally for figures and tables.<br>
<p>
                    ---         ---<br>
                --- | |         | |<br>
	--- --- | | | |     --- | | &lt;- font height<br>
	ABC | | | | | |     | | | |<br>
	--- | | | | --- --- | | --- &lt;- baseline<br>
<i>            | | ___     | | | |</i><br>
            ---         | | ---<br>
<i>                        | |</i><br>
                        ---<br>
<p>
	    top mid bot bas bas bas<br>
                        top mid bot<br>
<p>
Containers and Spacing<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
If browser layout is parsed and understood internally in a container-like<br>
manner, it should not be difficult to give every element a margin on each<br>
side, which specifies the amount of space above, below, and to the sides<br>
of an element. In this way, margins for an entire document as well as<br>
margins for a particular element can be specified.<br>
<p>
	margin values can be top, bottom, left, right<br>
<p>
	BODY	: margin.top = 10px<br>
	BODY	: margin.bottom = 10px<br>
	P	: margin.left = 10px<br>
<p>
Regarding "container" properties, one can think of borders and styles,<br>
backgrounds and foregrounds, and (tiled) images.<br>
<p>
	BODY	: background.color = red<br>
	BODY	: foreground.color = blue<br>
	BODY	: background.image = "<a href="http://somewhere.com/tile.gif">http://somewhere.com/tile.gif</a>"<br>
	P	: border.width = 3px<br>
<p>
	border.style may be none, default, line, bevel<br>
<p>
	P	: border.style = line<br>
	P	: border.color = black<br>
	P	: border.image = "picture.frame.tile.gif"<br>
<p>
The border may go inside, centered with, or outside the margin boundaries.<br>
A property name should be suggested for this - somehow "justify" and<br>
"align" don't seem appropriate.<br>
<p>
Line size could be specified. When applied to a textual element, this<br>
would indicate leading, the space below a line's baseline. When applied<br>
to an element like HR, this refers to the height of the element.<br>
<p>
	HR	: line.size = 3px<br>
	P	: line.size = 12pt<br>
<p>
Line indentation can be specified for elements - most designers find<br>
general indents and indents for the first line to be desireable. So:<br>
<p>
	P	: line.indent.first = 1in<br>
	P	: line.indent = 0.5in<br>
<p>
So the general spacing model for an element would look like:<br>
<p>
	------------------ &lt;- margin.top<br>
<i>	| blah blah...   |</i><br>
<i>	|                | &lt;- line.indent.first</i><br>
<i>	|                | &lt;- line.indent</i><br>
<i>	|                | &lt;- line.size (leading)</i><br>
<i>	|                |</i><br>
	------------------ &lt;- margin.bottom<br>
        ^                ^<br>
	margin.left      margin.right<br>
<p>
In this model, no negative values are allowed.<br>
<p>
Fonts<br>
~~~~~<br>
<p>
Technically a font has a few basic properties:<br>
<p>
	font.family (Helvetica, Lucida)<br>
	font.weight (Plain, Bold, Roman)<br>
	font.angle (Italic, Regular)<br>
	font.variation (Regular, Compressed)<br>
<p>
Although one should be able to completely specify a font with these<br>
attributes, things can and should be simplified:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.name = "Helvetica Compressed Bold Italic"<br>
<p>
font.name would allow one to specify a font by its full name as a<br>
shortcut. However, using the prior four variables may be desired since<br>
they could provide hints to the browser on how to generate the font<br>
on the fly.<br>
<p>
Hakon suggested that the order of the words in font.name should not<br>
matter - the set should be descriptive enough to find a particular<br>
font.<br>
<p>
Besides font.size and font.color, I would propose font.style, which<br>
would provide hints to the browser as how to display the given font.<br>
This style would be generated dynamically (mathematically perhaps),<br>
based on the given font name or family/weight/angle/variation set.<br>
<p>
	font.style may be default, plain, bold, italic, underline,<br>
		double underline, strikethrough, overline, change bar,<br>
		inverse, superscript, subscript, outline, shadow,<br>
		small caps, big caps, lowercase, uppercase<br>
<p>
The case styles would display text as follows:<br>
<p>
	plain:      "John Smith studies at MIT."<br>
	small caps: "john smith studies at mIT."<br>
	big caps:   "John Smith Studies At MIT."<br>
	lowercase:  "john smith studies at mit."<br>
	uppercase:  "JOHN SMITH STUDIES AT MIT."<br>
<p>
Of course you could specify multiple values where it makes sense:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.style = subscript &amp; bold<br>
<p>
One desired style is using an all-capitals string with larger<br>
capitals at the beginning of words. One way to do this may be:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.style = uppercase &amp; bigcaps<br>
<p>
Much in the same way that one can specify different spacing for the<br>
first line of an element, one should be able to specify different<br>
styles for the first letter of a word. This may enable things<br>
like drop caps.<br>
<p>
	P	: font.family.dropcap = Times<br>
	P	: font.family.firstletter = Times<br>
<p>
The first example changes the first letter in the entire paragraph;<br>
the second changes the first letter of every word.<br>
<p>
For elements such as drop caps and images there should be a way<br>
to specify how many lines high the element is compared to the<br>
normal text, and how that element should be aligned in respect<br>
to the first line of the element. This is so things like this<br>
can be made:<br>
<p>
	---- blah blah blah<br>
<i>        |  | blah blah blah</i><br>
        ---- blah blah blah<br>
	blah blah blah blah<br>
<p>
	P	: font.size.dropcap += 3pt<br>
<p>
	The dropcap is 3 points larger than the element's normal<br>
	font size.<br>
<p>
	P	: font.size.dropcap *= 4<br>
<p>
	The size of the dropcap is four times bigger than the<br>
	size of the normal font size.<br>
<p>
	P            : align.dropcap = top<br>
	IMG[dropcap] : align.dropcap = top<br>
<p>
	When a dropcap has an alignment of "top" its top is<br>
	aligned with the first line of the element and drops below<br>
	that line, allowing subsequent lines to wrap around it.<br>
<p>
	Perhaps there should be "align.topwrap" and "align.bottomwrap"<br>
	instead?<br>
<p>
Links<br>
~~~~~<br>
<p>
The designer should be able to specify how links are displayed, but<br>
users should be able to easily override these specifications, as<br>
they may be dependent on a particular navigation style. "imglink"<br>
would refer to a link on an image, while "txtlink" would refer to<br>
a textual link.<br>
<p>
	txtlink.color = blue<br>
	txtlink.color = blue &lt; AGE / 7d &lt; "Background Color"<br>
	imglink.color = default<br>
	imglink.size = 3px<br>
	imglink.style may be line, bevel, default, none<br>
	txtlink.style may be underline, double underline,<br>
		inverse, default, none<br>
<p>
Note that in conjunction with AGE links may be colored dynamically.<br>
If there is a predefined value for the background color, links can<br>
disappear with time and yet still be active, as in the example above.<br>
<p>
There should be a way to specify new versus followed links, but I<br>
have no good ideas as how to do so.<br>
<p>
Based on something Hakon said:<br>
<p>
	HTML	: txtlink.color = red &lt; FETCHED &lt; blue<br>
<p>
Style Sheet Permissions<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
There should be an extra layer in the current permissions model:<br>
<p>
		&lt;- author insist | legal<br>
	user insist<br>
	author important<br>
	user important<br>
	author normal<br>
	user normal<br>
	application default<br>
<p>
"author insist" would first display the page as the author intended<br>
but allow the user to change the style (for example, via a pop-up<br>
"styles" menu in the browser) after the initial download. The "legal"<br>
specification would display as the author intended and not allow the<br>
user to make changes. If the particular style in a browser was not<br>
supported for a legal document, then the document would not display<br>
at all.<br>
<p>
	P	: font.size = 12pt ! legal<br>
<p>
Authors writing legal documents may first display a readable<br>
disclaimer which tells the user what they must to do read the legal<br>
document (get a particular browser, enter a password, use a particular<br>
style, etc.), why it is legal (display copyrights, licensing restrictions,<br>
etc.) and then link to the document in question.<br>
<p>
Bill Perry suggests that it is more reasonable is for a dialog box to appear:<br>
<p>
	"Your settings will override something flagged as 'legal'.<br>
	Should I continue?"<br>
<p>
	[ OK ] [ Cancel ]<br>
<p>
All of this was a heavily debated issue at Darmstadt and will continue<br>
to be for some time. One thing to consider is that in the real world,<br>
given enough time and resources, you can copy anything man-made reasonably<br>
well and change it to suit your worldview. People will always want<br>
to do this to things. Now that it can be very easy for them to do so,<br>
why not let them?<br>
<p>
Users should be able to specify particular styles they do not want<br>
to see, for instance, a color blind user may never want to see any<br>
elements colored red or blue and instead would wish them to be colored<br>
black. Dave Raggett notes that authors, not users, should be the ones to<br>
anticipate this type of need in the style sheet. Forcing the browser<br>
to deal with it would lead to crude results.<br>
<p>
Note that the issues of filtering out particular styles and filtering<br>
out particular media/textual content are somewhat different and discussions<br>
regarding them should keep this in mind. The style area of a document<br>
should hold information related to layout and "look and feel". Within<br>
the content area, things that more closely affect the textual/media<br>
content should be put there, such as ways to represent different languages<br>
and multiple versions of the same content (animations, ISMAP things, etc.).<br>
Care should be taken not to confuse the two.<br>
<p>
Dave Raggett suggests that the style sheet should have a way to insert<br>
particular elements into the document so that one could create<br>
templates, page headers and footers, etc. easily.<br>
<p>
Perhaps:<br>
<p>
	HEADER	: insert "page.header.html"<br>
	FOOTER	: insert "page.footer.html"<br>
<p>
	This inserts HTML within tags, while:<br>
<p>
	H1	: insert.before "&lt;IMG SRC=\"rule.gif\"&gt;"<br>
	H1	: insert.after "some text"<br>
<p>
	adds text/HTML before or after elements.<br>
<p>
Industrial-Strength Stuff<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
Here are some features which may also be added, in no particular order:<br>
<p>
	Kerning<br>
	Tracking (spaces between words, letters, spacing limits)<br>
	The ability to specify particular color models<br>
	Columns (auto flow, positioning)<br>
	Ways to allow elements to float over others<br>
	Different ways of word wrapping<br>
	Ways to handle breaks in text<br>
	Page numbering<br>
	Numbering of list elements<br>
	Transitions (a la a presentation program)<br>
	Control over text flow<br>
<p>
Finally...<br>
~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
We should be seeing a full description of the experimental notation,<br>
with proposals, etc. and a full listing of properties, values,<br>
meta-variables, etc. on the Web pretty soon.<br>
<p>
The above examples and features cover a good deal of the general<br>
functionality of the most common DTP programs and remove the need<br>
for many of the nonstandard HTML extensions that are seen today.<br>
With a powerful style sheet language, the Web will certainly take on<br>
a new level of sophistication and many of the problems authors have<br>
had in the past regarding online design and layout will be solved.<br>
Dave Raggett notes that notation that is meant to be read and used by<br>
humans must have the right level of abstraction so that users and authors<br>
can easily control style.<br>
<p>
The web's incorporation of style sheets will certainly raise the<br>
level of expectation higher: users will not just expect to see a few<br>
blocks of text but will soon expect the features previously only available<br>
in "real" desktop publishing programs. Because of this it's quite<br>
possible that developers will force themselves to look at parsing<br>
and browser architecture in a more object-oriented manner, giving<br>
way to a more modular, container-based approach. Arena and Bert Bos's<br>
work are starting points, but once you add in OpenDoc or OLE,<br>
COBRA, HotJava, etc. you can begin to see how powerful that<br>
approach can be.<br>
<p>
People will finally think more about the structure of information<br>
and more about making it universal and interchangable. And hopefully<br>
we can finally see some serious content on the Internet.<br>
<p>
Arena is currently implementing Hakon's style sheet format, as is<br>
Bill Perry - what is needed is a lot more discussion and real code<br>
out there before a proposal can be presented to an IETF working group.<br>
Hakon says that a W3C workshop on stylesheets is planned for September;<br>
hopefully we'll see some good things happen before then.<br>

	This post is a long one; I would encourage replies to be<br>
broken up into manageable subjects such as fonts, etc.<br>
	The following thoughts revolve around creating a simple<br>
yet powerful style sheet language for the World-Wide Web. I have<br>
incorporated comments here and there from a previous email<br>
discussion involving Hakon Lie, Dave Raggett, Dan Connolly, and<br>
Bill Perry. Hakon should feel free to put this post under the<br>
style sheet area at the W3O site.<br>
	A W3 style-sheet mailing list will likely be created,<br>
but Hakon says this will take some days. There should be pointers<br>
at <a href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</a> in time. In the meantime you can refer to:<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/archives.html">http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/archives.html</a><br>
<p>
	If you're not familiar with style sheets, please take<br>
a look at:<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Style/">http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Style/</a><br>
<p>
	...and take a look at the current proposals and ideas out<br>
there.<br>
	The format I discuss below is a bit different and somewhat<br>
improved over Hakon's format as described at the Chicago conference:<br>

	<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/People/howcome/p/cascade.html">http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/People/howcome/p/cascade.html</a><br>
<p>
	...but from the examples below it should be fairly easy<br>
to figure things out.<br>
	Finally, a few seconds of silence for the NSFNET backbone<br>
service, which was decommissioned yesterday, April 30, 1995.<br>
	May it rest in peace,<br>

Thinking About Style Sheets<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
Hakon Lie described a simple yet powerful style sheet format in<br>
Darmstadt, one which he has been working on for some time and had<br>
been greatly improved since its first rollout in Chicago. Despite<br>
that fact that it has not been formally described anywhere, I feel<br>
that the format is superior to the other proposed formats for a number<br>
of reasons:<br>
<p>
	1) It's simple yet flexible.<br>
<p>
	Many proposed formats are much too complex for their own<br>
	good - in order to read the simplest formatting commands,<br>
	browsers have to parse ornate structures and operations<br>
	which add little to the overall utility of the format.<br>
	Hakon's format is broken into manageable, logical chunks<br>
	that allow for extensibility and ease of parsing. The<br>
	format is also well-suited to be written in a compact format<br>
	that keeps the style sheet size to a minimum.<br>
<p>
	2) It's human readable and writeable.<br>
<p>
	The Web no longer belongs to the average Internet-savvy<br>
	technician who writes daily in Perl and C++. In order to<br>
	urge authors and designers to make use of style sheets<br>
	the format must be understandable so that one can "look<br>
	under the hood" when needed. Certainly tools and editors<br>
	will be created that makes style sheet creation easy,<br>
	but the Web will be rewarded a hundredfold by using a<br>
	format for which it is easy to create tools for.<br>
<p>
Below I propose a number of changes and additions to Hakon's format,<br>
using the time-tested lessons learned by the most popular DTP<br>
software packages on the market today as well as a little Web design<br>
experience. I feel that style sheets have the potential to revolutionize<br>
the way people use and think about the Web and hope that the standards<br>
process does the right thing both for users and authors.<br>
<p>
Note that many of the examples below will replace the need for using<br>
tag attributes and nonstandard HTML extensions to create layout. This<br>
is a good thing, as the layout/style will finally be separated more<br>
cleanly from the document structure.<br>
<p>
The idea, if I understand correctly, is:<br>
<p>
	&lt;HTML&gt;<br>
	&lt;STYLE NOTATION="experimental"&gt;<br>
<p>
	&lt;!-- The style sheet (or perhaps a pointer to it) goes here. --&gt;<br>
	&lt;!-- Here I can define a particular style, or rather, a CLASS. --&gt;<br>
<p>
	P[mystyle] : font.size = 12pt<br>
<p>
	&lt;/STYLE&gt;<br>
	&lt;BODY&gt;<br>
	Regular structured markup goes here.<br>
<p>
	&lt;P CLASS="mystyle"&gt;This is a paragraph in my style,<br>
	with a font size of 12 points.<br>
	&lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
	&lt;/HTML&gt;<br>
<p>
If you find this pretty easy to understand, well, that's the idea.<br>
Browsers may very well support DTDs as well as a readable style sheet<br>
format like Hakon's.<br>
<p>
Linked style sheets will announce themselves to browsers with a MIME<br>
type such as:<br>
<p>
	application/x-perry-stylesheet<br>
	application/x-arena-stylesheet<br>
	application/x-w3c-experimental<br>
	application/x-dsssl-lite<br>
<p>
New Things<br>
~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
I would say that authors should have the capability to include<br>
style sheets within the document as well as point to particular<br>
style sheets (that is, link to them). This makes it easy for a site<br>
to have a directory of "house" style sheets that apply to all documents<br>
in a particular web.<br>
<p>
First, there should be a way to specify data that applies to all tags,<br>
or data that applies to entire style sheet or class of objects. This<br>
may be done with wildcards:<br>
<p>
	BODY	: *.color = red<br>
	doc	: *.color = red<br>
	*	: font.size = 12pt<br>
<p>
"doc" is something representing the entire document. Most likely<br>
this should be replaced with HTML, as one may want different<br>
properties for HEAD and BODY.<br>
<p>
Apparently Hakon's notation allows for pattern matching on<br>
sequences of tags, hierarchies of tags, and attribute values.<br>
<p>
	HTML	: *.color = red<br>
<p>
In the second example, the font size of 12 points applies to the data in<br>
all tags. In the first example, the color of all elements in the BODY<br>
tag are red.<br>
<p>
In regards to sizes and such, there should be a way to specify a<br>
base size and then allow other styles to be sized relative to the<br>
base size.<br>
<p>
	H1	: font.size += 3pt<br>
	H1	: font.size = P[mystyle]:font.size + 10pt<br>
	H1	: font.size = 1.5 * P:font.size<br>
<p>
There should be a full listing and study of the proposed format<br>
name hierarchy, so that attributes are named in a logical, structured<br>
manner. More general objects should be on the left, with values becoming<br>
more specific to the right. So "color.background" should instead<br>
be "background.color", because background is a general object, while<br>
color is a specific property.<br>
<p>
Style sheets should support the most common units in DTP; these may be:<br>
<p>
	inches (in)<br>
	pixels (px)<br>
	centimeters/millimeters (cm/mm)<br>
	ems (em)<br>
	points (pt)<br>
	characters(ch)<br>
	pica(pi) - "pi" is equal to 12pt<br>
<p>
The characters unit is needed because a designer may wish to specify<br>
an indent or tab stop by the number of characters in the current font,<br>
for instance, in a PRE tag.<br>
<p>
All elements that support values should support a value of "default".<br>
Browsers would come out of the box with a default style sheet preselected<br>
that the user never need change if they don't want to.<br>
<p>
One possible way to specify tab stops might be:<br>
<p>
	PRE	: tabs = 8ch, 16ch, 24ch<br>
<p>
Dave Raggett notes that this is discouraged, as HTML 3.0 includes<br>
a TAB element that does many nice things.<br>
<p>
It would be useful to allow a number of format "shortcuts" so that people<br>
writing sheets manually don't have to type so much and so that the size<br>
of the style sheet stays at a minimum. One possible thing to do is to<br>
use the semicolon (is there a more appropriate character?) for allowing<br>
the designer to specify multiple values for multiple tags:<br>
<p>
	P H1     : font.color = red; blue<br>
	H1 H2 LI : font.size = 1.0; 0.8; 0.2<br>
<p>
In the first example, data in P tags would be red; data in H1 tags<br>
would be blue.<br>
<p>
In the second, the font size in H1 is the normal default size, H2<br>
has a font size of 0.8 times that, and LI has a font size of 0.2<br>
times that.<br>
<p>
Bill Perry suggests another kind of shortcut:<br>
<p>
	H1	: font.size=12pt; background.color = red;<br>
		  foreground.color = blue<br>
<p>
This is very nice, as authors can deal with a whole tag at a time on<br>
one line or split things up over multiple lines so the organization<br>
makes more sense. Again, this is for human usability.<br>
<p>
Another kind of shortcut is to provide shorter versions of<br>
words:<br>
<p>
	"img" for "image"<br>
	"bg" for "background"<br>
<p>
	H1	: bg.color = blue<br>
<p>
In specifying color, the designer should be able to enter the<br>
decimal/percentage values using the RGB color space, since it is more<br>
understandable and most image processing programs use these values:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.color = 191, 191, 191<br>
	P	: font.color = 0.75, 0.75, 0.75<br>
<p>
The percentages are percents of the range from 0 to 255. In the<br>
3D world, the range would be from 0 to 1, but we're not dealing with<br>
that context (yet).<br>
<p>
It would also be nice if one could define style-sheet specific color<br>
labels so that colors could be referred to by name rather than by number:<br>
<p>
	define "My Gray" "191, 191, 191"<br>
	P	: font.color = "My Gray"<br>
<p>
The use of such pre-processor-like definitions could be considered a<br>
good thing, since it again reduces the style sheet size and makes<br>
readability easier. For colors, as an example, one may be able to<br>
specify the color name as given in the X11 rgb database.<br>
<p>
It may be useful to allow the designer to provide hints about the<br>
document dimensions, but it is unclear as to where and how such metadata<br>
might be specified. Perhaps:<br>
<p>
	HTML	: width = 600px<br>
	HTML	: height = 800px<br>
<p>
Some browsers have a widget that when selected sizes the window to<br>
the widest non-textual element on the screen. I think the browser<br>
should resize itself automatically according to these hints if the user<br>
wants.<br>
<p>
Alignment and Justification<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
Alignment should refer to vertical movement, as in the IMG tag, while<br>
justification should be used to specify horizontal movement. Thus:<br>
<p>
	align may be top, middle, bottom, basetop, basemiddle, basebottom<br>
	justify may be left, right, center, full<br>
<p>
	IMG	: align = basetop<br>
	P	: justify = center<br>
<p>
Top, middle, and bottom align elements relative to the size of the<br>
highest character on the current line, measured from the baseline.<br>
<p>
Dave Raggett comments that HTML has got it wrong in this respect, with<br>
ALIGN being used for vertical and horizontal alignment. I say that although<br>
it's probably too late to change things in HTML, let's get it right in<br>
style sheets.<br>
<p>
Dave also says that one needs bleedleft, bleedright, and bleedboth<br>
additionally for figures and tables.<br>
<p>
                    ---         ---<br>
                --- | |         | |<br>
	--- --- | | | |     --- | | &lt;- font height<br>
	ABC | | | | | |     | | | |<br>
	--- | | | | --- --- | | --- &lt;- baseline<br>
<i>            | | ___     | | | |</i><br>
            ---         | | ---<br>
<i>                        | |</i><br>
                        ---<br>
<p>
	    top mid bot bas bas bas<br>
                        top mid bot<br>
<p>
Containers and Spacing<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
If browser layout is parsed and understood internally in a container-like<br>
manner, it should not be difficult to give every element a margin on each<br>
side, which specifies the amount of space above, below, and to the sides<br>
of an element. In this way, margins for an entire document as well as<br>
margins for a particular element can be specified.<br>
<p>
	margin values can be top, bottom, left, right<br>
<p>
	BODY	: margin.top = 10px<br>
	BODY	: margin.bottom = 10px<br>
	P	: margin.left = 10px<br>
<p>
Regarding "container" properties, one can think of borders and styles,<br>
backgrounds and foregrounds, and (tiled) images.<br>
<p>
	BODY	: background.color = red<br>
	BODY	: foreground.color = blue<br>
	BODY	: background.image = "<a href="http://somewhere.com/tile.gif">http://somewhere.com/tile.gif</a>"<br>
	P	: border.width = 3px<br>
<p>
	border.style may be none, default, line, bevel<br>
<p>
	P	: border.style = line<br>
	P	: border.color = black<br>
	P	: border.image = "picture.frame.tile.gif"<br>
<p>
The border may go inside, centered with, or outside the margin boundaries.<br>
A property name should be suggested for this - somehow "justify" and<br>
"align" don't seem appropriate.<br>
<p>
Line size could be specified. When applied to a textual element, this<br>
would indicate leading, the space below a line's baseline. When applied<br>
to an element like HR, this refers to the height of the element.<br>
<p>
	HR	: line.size = 3px<br>
	P	: line.size = 12pt<br>
<p>
Line indentation can be specified for elements - most designers find<br>
general indents and indents for the first line to be desireable. So:<br>
<p>
	P	: line.indent.first = 1in<br>
	P	: line.indent = 0.5in<br>
<p>
So the general spacing model for an element would look like:<br>
<p>
	------------------ &lt;- margin.top<br>
<i>	| blah blah...   |</i><br>
<i>	|                | &lt;- line.indent.first</i><br>
<i>	|                | &lt;- line.indent</i><br>
<i>	|                | &lt;- line.size (leading)</i><br>
<i>	|                |</i><br>
	------------------ &lt;- margin.bottom<br>
        ^                ^<br>
	margin.left      margin.right<br>
<p>
In this model, no negative values are allowed.<br>
<p>
Fonts<br>
~~~~~<br>
<p>
Technically a font has a few basic properties:<br>
<p>
	font.family (Helvetica, Lucida)<br>
	font.weight (Plain, Bold, Roman)<br>
	font.angle (Italic, Regular)<br>
	font.variation (Regular, Compressed)<br>
<p>
Although one should be able to completely specify a font with these<br>
attributes, things can and should be simplified:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.name = "Helvetica Compressed Bold Italic"<br>
<p>
font.name would allow one to specify a font by its full name as a<br>
shortcut. However, using the prior four variables may be desired since<br>
they could provide hints to the browser on how to generate the font<br>
on the fly.<br>
<p>
Hakon suggested that the order of the words in font.name should not<br>
matter - the set should be descriptive enough to find a particular<br>
font.<br>
<p>
Besides font.size and font.color, I would propose font.style, which<br>
would provide hints to the browser as how to display the given font.<br>
This style would be generated dynamically (mathematically perhaps),<br>
based on the given font name or family/weight/angle/variation set.<br>
<p>
	font.style may be default, plain, bold, italic, underline,<br>
		double underline, strikethrough, overline, change bar,<br>
		inverse, superscript, subscript, outline, shadow,<br>
		small caps, big caps, lowercase, uppercase<br>
<p>
The case styles would display text as follows:<br>
<p>
	plain:      "John Smith studies at MIT."<br>
	small caps: "john smith studies at mIT."<br>
	big caps:   "John Smith Studies At MIT."<br>
	lowercase:  "john smith studies at mit."<br>
	uppercase:  "JOHN SMITH STUDIES AT MIT."<br>
<p>
Of course you could specify multiple values where it makes sense:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.style = subscript &amp; bold<br>
<p>
One desired style is using an all-capitals string with larger<br>
capitals at the beginning of words. One way to do this may be:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.style = uppercase &amp; bigcaps<br>
<p>
Much in the same way that one can specify different spacing for the<br>
first line of an element, one should be able to specify different<br>
styles for the first letter of a word. This may enable things<br>
like drop caps.<br>
<p>
	P	: font.family.dropcap = Times<br>
	P	: font.family.firstletter = Times<br>
<p>
The first example changes the first letter in the entire paragraph;<br>
the second changes the first letter of every word.<br>
<p>
For elements such as drop caps and images there should be a way<br>
to specify how many lines high the element is compared to the<br>
normal text, and how that element should be aligned in respect<br>
to the first line of the element. This is so things like this<br>
can be made:<br>
<p>
	---- blah blah blah<br>
<i>        |  | blah blah blah</i><br>
        ---- blah blah blah<br>
	blah blah blah blah<br>
<p>
	P	: font.size.dropcap += 3pt<br>
<p>
	The dropcap is 3 points larger than the element's normal<br>
	font size.<br>
<p>
	P	: font.size.dropcap *= 4<br>
<p>
	The size of the dropcap is four times bigger than the<br>
	size of the normal font size.<br>
<p>
	P            : align.dropcap = top<br>
	IMG[dropcap] : align.dropcap = top<br>
<p>
	When a dropcap has an alignment of "top" its top is<br>
	aligned with the first line of the element and drops below<br>
	that line, allowing subsequent lines to wrap around it.<br>
<p>
	Perhaps there should be "align.topwrap" and "align.bottomwrap"<br>
	instead?<br>
<p>
Links<br>
~~~~~<br>
<p>
The designer should be able to specify how links are displayed, but<br>
users should be able to easily override these specifications, as<br>
they may be dependent on a particular navigation style. "imglink"<br>
would refer to a link on an image, while "txtlink" would refer to<br>
a textual link.<br>
<p>
	txtlink.color = blue<br>
	txtlink.color = blue &lt; AGE / 7d &lt; "Background Color"<br>
	imglink.color = default<br>
	imglink.size = 3px<br>
	imglink.style may be line, bevel, default, none<br>
	txtlink.style may be underline, double underline,<br>
		inverse, default, none<br>
<p>
Note that in conjunction with AGE links may be colored dynamically.<br>
If there is a predefined value for the background color, links can<br>
disappear with time and yet still be active, as in the example above.<br>
<p>
There should be a way to specify new versus followed links, but I<br>
have no good ideas as how to do so.<br>
<p>
Based on something Hakon said:<br>
<p>
	HTML	: txtlink.color = red &lt; FETCHED &lt; blue<br>
<p>
Style Sheet Permissions<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
There should be an extra layer in the current permissions model:<br>
<p>
		&lt;- author insist | legal<br>
	user insist<br>
	author important<br>
	user important<br>
	author normal<br>
	user normal<br>
	application default<br>
<p>
"author insist" would first display the page as the author intended<br>
but allow the user to change the style (for example, via a pop-up<br>
"styles" menu in the browser) after the initial download. The "legal"<br>
specification would display as the author intended and not allow the<br>
user to make changes. If the particular style in a browser was not<br>
supported for a legal document, then the document would not display<br>
at all.<br>
<p>
	P	: font.size = 12pt ! legal<br>
<p>
Authors writing legal documents may first display a readable<br>
disclaimer which tells the user what they must to do read the legal<br>
document (get a particular browser, enter a password, use a particular<br>
style, etc.), why it is legal (display copyrights, licensing restrictions,<br>
etc.) and then link to the document in question.<br>
<p>
Bill Perry suggests that it is more reasonable is for a dialog box to appear:<br>
<p>
	"Your settings will override something flagged as 'legal'.<br>
	Should I continue?"<br>
<p>
	[ OK ] [ Cancel ]<br>
<p>
All of this was a heavily debated issue at Darmstadt and will continue<br>
to be for some time. One thing to consider is that in the real world,<br>
given enough time and resources, you can copy anything man-made reasonably<br>
well and change it to suit your worldview. People will always want<br>
to do this to things. Now that it can be very easy for them to do so,<br>
why not let them?<br>
<p>
Users should be able to specify particular styles they do not want<br>
to see, for instance, a color blind user may never want to see any<br>
elements colored red or blue and instead would wish them to be colored<br>
black. Dave Raggett notes that authors, not users, should be the ones to<br>
anticipate this type of need in the style sheet. Forcing the browser<br>
to deal with it would lead to crude results.<br>
<p>
Note that the issues of filtering out particular styles and filtering<br>
out particular media/textual content are somewhat different and discussions<br>
regarding them should keep this in mind. The style area of a document<br>
should hold information related to layout and "look and feel". Within<br>
the content area, things that more closely affect the textual/media<br>
content should be put there, such as ways to represent different languages<br>
and multiple versions of the same content (animations, ISMAP things, etc.).<br>
Care should be taken not to confuse the two.<br>
<p>
Dave Raggett suggests that the style sheet should have a way to insert<br>
particular elements into the document so that one could create<br>
templates, page headers and footers, etc. easily.<br>
<p>
Perhaps:<br>
<p>
	HEADER	: insert "page.header.html"<br>
	FOOTER	: insert "page.footer.html"<br>
<p>
	This inserts HTML within tags, while:<br>
<p>
	H1	: insert.before "&lt;IMG SRC=\"rule.gif\"&gt;"<br>
	H1	: insert.after "some text"<br>
<p>
	adds text/HTML before or after elements.<br>
<p>
Industrial-Strength Stuff<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
Here are some features which may also be added, in no particular order:<br>
<p>
	Kerning<br>
	Tracking (spaces between words, letters, spacing limits)<br>
	The ability to specify particular color models<br>
	Columns (auto flow, positioning)<br>
	Ways to allow elements to float over others<br>
	Different ways of word wrapping<br>
	Ways to handle breaks in text<br>
	Page numbering<br>
	Numbering of list elements<br>
	Transitions (a la a presentation program)<br>
	Control over text flow<br>
<p>
Finally...<br>
~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
We should be seeing a full description of the experimental notation,<br>
with proposals, etc. and a full listing of properties, values,<br>
meta-variables, etc. on the Web pretty soon.<br>
<p>
The above examples and features cover a good deal of the general<br>
functionality of the most common DTP programs and remove the need<br>
for many of the nonstandard HTML extensions that are seen today.<br>
With a powerful style sheet language, the Web will certainly take on<br>
a new level of sophistication and many of the problems authors have<br>
had in the past regarding online design and layout will be solved.<br>
Dave Raggett notes that notation that is meant to be read and used by<br>
humans must have the right level of abstraction so that users and authors<br>
can easily control style.<br>
<p>
The web's incorporation of style sheets will certainly raise the<br>
level of expectation higher: users will not just expect to see a few<br>
blocks of text but will soon expect the features previously only available<br>
in "real" desktop publishing programs. Because of this it's quite<br>
possible that developers will force themselves to look at parsing<br>
and browser architecture in a more object-oriented manner, giving<br>
way to a more modular, container-based approach. Arena and Bert Bos's<br>
work are starting points, but once you add in OpenDoc or OLE,<br>
COBRA, HotJava, etc. you can begin to see how powerful that<br>
approach can be.<br>
<p>
People will finally think more about the structure of information<br>
and more about making it universal and interchangable. And hopefully<br>
we can finally see some serious content on the Internet.<br>
<p>
Arena is currently implementing Hakon's style sheet format, as is<br>
Bill Perry - what is needed is a lot more discussion and real code<br>
out there before a proposal can be presented to an IETF working group.<br>
Hakon says that a W3C workshop on stylesheets is planned for September;<br>
hopefully we'll see some good things happen before then.<br>

	This post is a long one; I would encourage replies to be<br>
broken up into manageable subjects such as fonts, etc.<br>
	The following thoughts revolve around creating a simple<br>
yet powerful style sheet language for the World-Wide Web. I have<br>
incorporated comments here and there from a previous email<br>
discussion involving Hakon Lie, Dave Raggett, Dan Connolly, and<br>
Bill Perry. Hakon should feel free to put this post under the<br>
style sheet area at the W3O site.<br>
	A W3 style-sheet mailing list will likely be created,<br>
but Hakon says this will take some days. There should be pointers<br>
at <a href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</a> in time. In the meantime you can refer to:<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/archives.html">http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/archives.html</a><br>
<p>
	If you're not familiar with style sheets, please take<br>
a look at:<br>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Style/">http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Style/</a><br>
<p>
	...and take a look at the current proposals and ideas out<br>
there.<br>
	The format I discuss below is a bit different and somewhat<br>
improved over Hakon's format as described at the Chicago conference:<br>

	<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/People/howcome/p/cascade.html">http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/People/howcome/p/cascade.html</a><br>
<p>
	...but from the examples below it should be fairly easy<br>
to figure things out.<br>
	Finally, a few seconds of silence for the NSFNET backbone<br>
service, which was decommissioned yesterday, April 30, 1995.<br>
	May it rest in peace,<br>

Thinking About Style Sheets<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
Hakon Lie described a simple yet powerful style sheet format in<br>
Darmstadt, one which he has been working on for some time and had<br>
been greatly improved since its first rollout in Chicago. Despite<br>
that fact that it has not been formally described anywhere, I feel<br>
that the format is superior to the other proposed formats for a number<br>
of reasons:<br>
<p>
	1) It's simple yet flexible.<br>
<p>
	Many proposed formats are much too complex for their own<br>
	good - in order to read the simplest formatting commands,<br>
	browsers have to parse ornate structures and operations<br>
	which add little to the overall utility of the format.<br>
	Hakon's format is broken into manageable, logical chunks<br>
	that allow for extensibility and ease of parsing. The<br>
	format is also well-suited to be written in a compact format<br>
	that keeps the style sheet size to a minimum.<br>
<p>
	2) It's human readable and writeable.<br>
<p>
	The Web no longer belongs to the average Internet-savvy<br>
	technician who writes daily in Perl and C++. In order to<br>
	urge authors and designers to make use of style sheets<br>
	the format must be understandable so that one can "look<br>
	under the hood" when needed. Certainly tools and editors<br>
	will be created that makes style sheet creation easy,<br>
	but the Web will be rewarded a hundredfold by using a<br>
	format for which it is easy to create tools for.<br>
<p>
Below I propose a number of changes and additions to Hakon's format,<br>
using the time-tested lessons learned by the most popular DTP<br>
software packages on the market today as well as a little Web design<br>
experience. I feel that style sheets have the potential to revolutionize<br>
the way people use and think about the Web and hope that the standards<br>
process does the right thing both for users and authors.<br>
<p>
Note that many of the examples below will replace the need for using<br>
tag attributes and nonstandard HTML extensions to create layout. This<br>
is a good thing, as the layout/style will finally be separated more<br>
cleanly from the document structure.<br>
<p>
The idea, if I understand correctly, is:<br>
<p>
	&lt;HTML&gt;<br>
	&lt;STYLE NOTATION="experimental"&gt;<br>
<p>
	&lt;!-- The style sheet (or perhaps a pointer to it) goes here. --&gt;<br>
	&lt;!-- Here I can define a particular style, or rather, a CLASS. --&gt;<br>
<p>
	P[mystyle] : font.size = 12pt<br>
<p>
	&lt;/STYLE&gt;<br>
	&lt;BODY&gt;<br>
	Regular structured markup goes here.<br>
<p>
	&lt;P CLASS="mystyle"&gt;This is a paragraph in my style,<br>
	with a font size of 12 points.<br>
	&lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
	&lt;/HTML&gt;<br>
<p>
If you find this pretty easy to understand, well, that's the idea.<br>
Browsers may very well support DTDs as well as a readable style sheet<br>
format like Hakon's.<br>
<p>
Linked style sheets will announce themselves to browsers with a MIME<br>
type such as:<br>
<p>
	application/x-perry-stylesheet<br>
	application/x-arena-stylesheet<br>
	application/x-w3c-experimental<br>
	application/x-dsssl-lite<br>
<p>
New Things<br>
~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
I would say that authors should have the capability to include<br>
style sheets within the document as well as point to particular<br>
style sheets (that is, link to them). This makes it easy for a site<br>
to have a directory of "house" style sheets that apply to all documents<br>
in a particular web.<br>
<p>
First, there should be a way to specify data that applies to all tags,<br>
or data that applies to entire style sheet or class of objects. This<br>
may be done with wildcards:<br>
<p>
	BODY	: *.color = red<br>
	doc	: *.color = red<br>
	*	: font.size = 12pt<br>
<p>
"doc" is something representing the entire document. Most likely<br>
this should be replaced with HTML, as one may want different<br>
properties for HEAD and BODY.<br>
<p>
Apparently Hakon's notation allows for pattern matching on<br>
sequences of tags, hierarchies of tags, and attribute values.<br>
<p>
	HTML	: *.color = red<br>
<p>
In the second example, the font size of 12 points applies to the data in<br>
all tags. In the first example, the color of all elements in the BODY<br>
tag are red.<br>
<p>
In regards to sizes and such, there should be a way to specify a<br>
base size and then allow other styles to be sized relative to the<br>
base size.<br>
<p>
	H1	: font.size += 3pt<br>
	H1	: font.size = P[mystyle]:font.size + 10pt<br>
	H1	: font.size = 1.5 * P:font.size<br>
<p>
There should be a full listing and study of the proposed format<br>
name hierarchy, so that attributes are named in a logical, structured<br>
manner. More general objects should be on the left, with values becoming<br>
more specific to the right. So "color.background" should instead<br>
be "background.color", because background is a general object, while<br>
color is a specific property.<br>
<p>
Style sheets should support the most common units in DTP; these may be:<br>
<p>
	inches (in)<br>
	pixels (px)<br>
	centimeters/millimeters (cm/mm)<br>
	ems (em)<br>
	points (pt)<br>
	characters(ch)<br>
	pica(pi) - "pi" is equal to 12pt<br>
<p>
The characters unit is needed because a designer may wish to specify<br>
an indent or tab stop by the number of characters in the current font,<br>
for instance, in a PRE tag.<br>
<p>
All elements that support values should support a value of "default".<br>
Browsers would come out of the box with a default style sheet preselected<br>
that the user never need change if they don't want to.<br>
<p>
One possible way to specify tab stops might be:<br>
<p>
	PRE	: tabs = 8ch, 16ch, 24ch<br>
<p>
Dave Raggett notes that this is discouraged, as HTML 3.0 includes<br>
a TAB element that does many nice things.<br>
<p>
It would be useful to allow a number of format "shortcuts" so that people<br>
writing sheets manually don't have to type so much and so that the size<br>
of the style sheet stays at a minimum. One possible thing to do is to<br>
use the semicolon (is there a more appropriate character?) for allowing<br>
the designer to specify multiple values for multiple tags:<br>
<p>
	P H1     : font.color = red; blue<br>
	H1 H2 LI : font.size = 1.0; 0.8; 0.2<br>
<p>
In the first example, data in P tags would be red; data in H1 tags<br>
would be blue.<br>
<p>
In the second, the font size in H1 is the normal default size, H2<br>
has a font size of 0.8 times that, and LI has a font size of 0.2<br>
times that.<br>
<p>
Bill Perry suggests another kind of shortcut:<br>
<p>
	H1	: font.size=12pt; background.color = red;<br>
		  foreground.color = blue<br>
<p>
This is very nice, as authors can deal with a whole tag at a time on<br>
one line or split things up over multiple lines so the organization<br>
makes more sense. Again, this is for human usability.<br>
<p>
Another kind of shortcut is to provide shorter versions of<br>
words:<br>
<p>
	"img" for "image"<br>
	"bg" for "background"<br>
<p>
	H1	: bg.color = blue<br>
<p>
In specifying color, the designer should be able to enter the<br>
decimal/percentage values using the RGB color space, since it is more<br>
understandable and most image processing programs use these values:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.color = 191, 191, 191<br>
	P	: font.color = 0.75, 0.75, 0.75<br>
<p>
The percentages are percents of the range from 0 to 255. In the<br>
3D world, the range would be from 0 to 1, but we're not dealing with<br>
that context (yet).<br>
<p>
It would also be nice if one could define style-sheet specific color<br>
labels so that colors could be referred to by name rather than by number:<br>
<p>
	define "My Gray" "191, 191, 191"<br>
	P	: font.color = "My Gray"<br>
<p>
The use of such pre-processor-like definitions could be considered a<br>
good thing, since it again reduces the style sheet size and makes<br>
readability easier. For colors, as an example, one may be able to<br>
specify the color name as given in the X11 rgb database.<br>
<p>
It may be useful to allow the designer to provide hints about the<br>
document dimensions, but it is unclear as to where and how such metadata<br>
might be specified. Perhaps:<br>
<p>
	HTML	: width = 600px<br>
	HTML	: height = 800px<br>
<p>
Some browsers have a widget that when selected sizes the window to<br>
the widest non-textual element on the screen. I think the browser<br>
should resize itself automatically according to these hints if the user<br>
wants.<br>
<p>
Alignment and Justification<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
Alignment should refer to vertical movement, as in the IMG tag, while<br>
justification should be used to specify horizontal movement. Thus:<br>
<p>
	align may be top, middle, bottom, basetop, basemiddle, basebottom<br>
	justify may be left, right, center, full<br>
<p>
	IMG	: align = basetop<br>
	P	: justify = center<br>
<p>
Top, middle, and bottom align elements relative to the size of the<br>
highest character on the current line, measured from the baseline.<br>
<p>
Dave Raggett comments that HTML has got it wrong in this respect, with<br>
ALIGN being used for vertical and horizontal alignment. I say that although<br>
it's probably too late to change things in HTML, let's get it right in<br>
style sheets.<br>
<p>
Dave also says that one needs bleedleft, bleedright, and bleedboth<br>
additionally for figures and tables.<br>
<p>
                    ---         ---<br>
                --- | |         | |<br>
	--- --- | | | |     --- | | &lt;- font height<br>
	ABC | | | | | |     | | | |<br>
	--- | | | | --- --- | | --- &lt;- baseline<br>
<i>            | | ___     | | | |</i><br>
            ---         | | ---<br>
<i>                        | |</i><br>
                        ---<br>
<p>
	    top mid bot bas bas bas<br>
                        top mid bot<br>
<p>
Containers and Spacing<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
If browser layout is parsed and understood internally in a container-like<br>
manner, it should not be difficult to give every element a margin on each<br>
side, which specifies the amount of space above, below, and to the sides<br>
of an element. In this way, margins for an entire document as well as<br>
margins for a particular element can be specified.<br>
<p>
	margin values can be top, bottom, left, right<br>
<p>
	BODY	: margin.top = 10px<br>
	BODY	: margin.bottom = 10px<br>
	P	: margin.left = 10px<br>
<p>
Regarding "container" properties, one can think of borders and styles,<br>
backgrounds and foregrounds, and (tiled) images.<br>
<p>
	BODY	: background.color = red<br>
	BODY	: foreground.color = blue<br>
	BODY	: background.image = "<a href="http://somewhere.com/tile.gif">http://somewhere.com/tile.gif</a>"<br>
	P	: border.width = 3px<br>
<p>
	border.style may be none, default, line, bevel<br>
<p>
	P	: border.style = line<br>
	P	: border.color = black<br>
	P	: border.image = "picture.frame.tile.gif"<br>
<p>
The border may go inside, centered with, or outside the margin boundaries.<br>
A property name should be suggested for this - somehow "justify" and<br>
"align" don't seem appropriate.<br>
<p>
Line size could be specified. When applied to a textual element, this<br>
would indicate leading, the space below a line's baseline. When applied<br>
to an element like HR, this refers to the height of the element.<br>
<p>
	HR	: line.size = 3px<br>
	P	: line.size = 12pt<br>
<p>
Line indentation can be specified for elements - most designers find<br>
general indents and indents for the first line to be desireable. So:<br>
<p>
	P	: line.indent.first = 1in<br>
	P	: line.indent = 0.5in<br>
<p>
So the general spacing model for an element would look like:<br>
<p>
	------------------ &lt;- margin.top<br>
<i>	| blah blah...   |</i><br>
<i>	|                | &lt;- line.indent.first</i><br>
<i>	|                | &lt;- line.indent</i><br>
<i>	|                | &lt;- line.size (leading)</i><br>
<i>	|                |</i><br>
	------------------ &lt;- margin.bottom<br>
        ^                ^<br>
	margin.left      margin.right<br>
<p>
In this model, no negative values are allowed.<br>
<p>
Fonts<br>
~~~~~<br>
<p>
Technically a font has a few basic properties:<br>
<p>
	font.family (Helvetica, Lucida)<br>
	font.weight (Plain, Bold, Roman)<br>
	font.angle (Italic, Regular)<br>
	font.variation (Regular, Compressed)<br>
<p>
Although one should be able to completely specify a font with these<br>
attributes, things can and should be simplified:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.name = "Helvetica Compressed Bold Italic"<br>
<p>
font.name would allow one to specify a font by its full name as a<br>
shortcut. However, using the prior four variables may be desired since<br>
they could provide hints to the browser on how to generate the font<br>
on the fly.<br>
<p>
Hakon suggested that the order of the words in font.name should not<br>
matter - the set should be descriptive enough to find a particular<br>
font.<br>
<p>
Besides font.size and font.color, I would propose font.style, which<br>
would provide hints to the browser as how to display the given font.<br>
This style would be generated dynamically (mathematically perhaps),<br>
based on the given font name or family/weight/angle/variation set.<br>
<p>
	font.style may be default, plain, bold, italic, underline,<br>
		double underline, strikethrough, overline, change bar,<br>
		inverse, superscript, subscript, outline, shadow,<br>
		small caps, big caps, lowercase, uppercase<br>
<p>
The case styles would display text as follows:<br>
<p>
	plain:      "John Smith studies at MIT."<br>
	small caps: "john smith studies at mIT."<br>
	big caps:   "John Smith Studies At MIT."<br>
	lowercase:  "john smith studies at mit."<br>
	uppercase:  "JOHN SMITH STUDIES AT MIT."<br>
<p>
Of course you could specify multiple values where it makes sense:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.style = subscript &amp; bold<br>
<p>
One desired style is using an all-capitals string with larger<br>
capitals at the beginning of words. One way to do this may be:<br>
<p>
	P	: font.style = uppercase &amp; bigcaps<br>
<p>
Much in the same way that one can specify different spacing for the<br>
first line of an element, one should be able to specify different<br>
styles for the first letter of a word. This may enable things<br>
like drop caps.<br>
<p>
	P	: font.family.dropcap = Times<br>
	P	: font.family.firstletter = Times<br>
<p>
The first example changes the first letter in the entire paragraph;<br>
the second changes the first letter of every word.<br>
<p>
For elements such as drop caps and images there should be a way<br>
to specify how many lines high the element is compared to the<br>
normal text, and how that element should be aligned in respect<br>
to the first line of the element. This is so things like this<br>
can be made:<br>
<p>
	---- blah blah blah<br>
<i>        |  | blah blah blah</i><br>
        ---- blah blah blah<br>
	blah blah blah blah<br>
<p>
	P	: font.size.dropcap += 3pt<br>
<p>
	The dropcap is 3 points larger than the element's normal<br>
	font size.<br>
<p>
	P	: font.size.dropcap *= 4<br>
<p>
	The size of the dropcap is four times bigger than the<br>
	size of the normal font size.<br>
<p>
	P            : align.dropcap = top<br>
	IMG[dropcap] : align.dropcap = top<br>
<p>
	When a dropcap has an alignment of "top" its top is<br>
	aligned with the first line of the element and drops below<br>
	that line, allowing subsequent lines to wrap around it.<br>
<p>
	Perhaps there should be "align.topwrap" and "align.bottomwrap"<br>
	instead?<br>
<p>
Links<br>
~~~~~<br>
<p>
The designer should be able to specify how links are displayed, but<br>
users should be able to easily override these specifications, as<br>
they may be dependent on a particular navigation style. "imglink"<br>
would refer to a link on an image, while "txtlink" would refer to<br>
a textual link.<br>
<p>
	txtlink.color = blue<br>
	txtlink.color = blue &lt; AGE / 7d &lt; "Background Color"<br>
	imglink.color = default<br>
	imglink.size = 3px<br>
	imglink.style may be line, bevel, default, none<br>
	txtlink.style may be underline, double underline,<br>
		inverse, default, none<br>
<p>
Note that in conjunction with AGE links may be colored dynamically.<br>
If there is a predefined value for the background color, links can<br>
disappear with time and yet still be active, as in the example above.<br>
<p>
There should be a way to specify new versus followed links, but I<br>
have no good ideas as how to do so.<br>
<p>
Based on something Hakon said:<br>
<p>
	HTML	: txtlink.color = red &lt; FETCHED &lt; blue<br>
<p>
Style Sheet Permissions<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
There should be an extra layer in the current permissions model:<br>
<p>
		&lt;- author insist | legal<br>
	user insist<br>
	author important<br>
	user important<br>
	author normal<br>
	user normal<br>
	application default<br>
<p>
"author insist" would first display the page as the author intended<br>
but allow the user to change the style (for example, via a pop-up<br>
"styles" menu in the browser) after the initial download. The "legal"<br>
specification would display as the author intended and not allow the<br>
user to make changes. If the particular style in a browser was not<br>
supported for a legal document, then the document would not display<br>
at all.<br>
<p>
	P	: font.size = 12pt ! legal<br>
<p>
Authors writing legal documents may first display a readable<br>
disclaimer which tells the user what they must to do read the legal<br>
document (get a particular browser, enter a password, use a particular<br>
style, etc.), why it is legal (display copyrights, licensing restrictions,<br>
etc.) and then link to the document in question.<br>
<p>
Bill Perry suggests that it is more reasonable is for a dialog box to appear:<br>
<p>
	"Your settings will override something flagged as 'legal'.<br>
	Should I continue?"<br>
<p>
	[ OK ] [ Cancel ]<br>
<p>
All of this was a heavily debated issue at Darmstadt and will continue<br>
to be for some time. One thing to consider is that in the real world,<br>
given enough time and resources, you can copy anything man-made reasonably<br>
well and change it to suit your worldview. People will always want<br>
to do this to things. Now that it can be very easy for them to do so,<br>
why not let them?<br>
<p>
Users should be able to specify particular styles they do not want<br>
to see, for instance, a color blind user may never want to see any<br>
elements colored red or blue and instead would wish them to be colored<br>
black. Dave Raggett notes that authors, not users, should be the ones to<br>
anticipate this type of need in the style sheet. Forcing the browser<br>
to deal with it would lead to crude results.<br>
<p>
Note that the issues of filtering out particular styles and filtering<br>
out particular media/textual content are somewhat different and discussions<br>
regarding them should keep this in mind. The style area of a document<br>
should hold information related to layout and "look and feel". Within<br>
the content area, things that more closely affect the textual/media<br>
content should be put there, such as ways to represent different languages<br>
and multiple versions of the same content (animations, ISMAP things, etc.).<br>
Care should be taken not to confuse the two.<br>
<p>
Dave Raggett suggests that the style sheet should have a way to insert<br>
particular elements into the document so that one could create<br>
templates, page headers and footers, etc. easily.<br>
<p>
Perhaps:<br>
<p>
	HEADER	: insert "page.header.html"<br>
	FOOTER	: insert "page.footer.html"<br>
<p>
	This inserts HTML within tags, while:<br>
<p>
	H1	: insert.before "&lt;IMG SRC=\"rule.gif\"&gt;"<br>
	H1	: insert.after "some text"<br>
<p>
	adds text/HTML before or after elements.<br>
<p>
Industrial-Strength Stuff<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
Here are some features which may also be added, in no particular order:<br>
<p>
	Kerning<br>
	Tracking (spaces between words, letters, spacing limits)<br>
	The ability to specify particular color models<br>
	Columns (auto flow, positioning)<br>
	Ways to allow elements to float over others<br>
	Different ways of word wrapping<br>
	Ways to handle breaks in text<br>
	Page numbering<br>
	Numbering of list elements<br>
	Transitions (a la a presentation program)<br>
	Control over text flow<br>
<p>
Finally...<br>
~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<p>
We should be seeing a full description of the experimental notation,<br>
with proposals, etc. and a full listing of properties, values,<br>
meta-variables, etc. on the Web pretty soon.<br>
<p>
The above examples and features cover a good deal of the general<br>
functionality of the most common DTP programs and remove the need<br>
for many of the nonstandard HTML extensions that are seen today.<br>
With a powerful style sheet language, the Web will certainly take on<br>
a new level of sophistication and many of the problems authors have<br>
had in the past regarding online design and layout will be solved.<br>
Dave Raggett notes that notation that is meant to be read and used by<br>
humans must have the right level of abstraction so that users and authors<br>
can easily control style.<br>
<p>
The web's incorporation of style sheets will certainly raise the<br>
level of expectation higher: users will not just expect to see a few<br>
blocks of text but will soon expect the features previously only available<br>
in "real" desktop publishing programs. Because of this it's quite<br>
possible that developers will force themselves to look at parsing<br>
and browser architecture in a more object-oriented manner, giving<br>
way to a more modular, container-based approach. Arena and Bert Bos's<br>
work are starting points, but once you add in OpenDoc or OLE,<br>
COBRA, HotJava, etc. you can begin to see how powerful that<br>
approach can be.<br>
<p>
People will finally think more about the structure of information<br>
and more about making it universal and interchangable. And hopefully<br>
we can finally see some serious content on the Internet.<br>
<p>
Arena is currently implementing Hakon's style sheet format, as is<br>
Bill Perry - what is needed is a lot more discussion and real code<br>
out there before a proposal can be presented to an IETF working group.<br>
Hakon says that a W3C workshop on stylesheets is planned for September;<br>
hopefully we'll see some good things happen before then.<br>
