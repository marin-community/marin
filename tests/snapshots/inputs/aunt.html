I don't know if you keep up with what's new in the crafty world, but Do-a-Dot Markers are <i>a thing,</i>&nbsp;especially amongst the under ten set. &nbsp;They come in an array of colors:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eJw5NFY9JPM/UWx8ku-59xI/AAAAAAAABNo/tcSG2z7NGxs/s1600/images-4.jpeg" imageanchor="1"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eJw5NFY9JPM/UWx8ku-59xI/AAAAAAAABNo/tcSG2z7NGxs/s1600/images-4.jpeg"></a></p><p>
And there are even Do-a-Dot activities that your kid can complete with the markers:</p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SM_znWB6V6Q/UWx8knwMUEI/AAAAAAAABNs/vsA_5BmzMrA/s1600/train+do-a-dot%255B3%255D.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img height="225" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SM_znWB6V6Q/UWx8knwMUEI/AAAAAAAABNs/vsA_5BmzMrA/s320/train+do-a-dot%255B3%255D.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>
I own a whopping six Do-a-Dot markers. &nbsp;My oldest son and his friends use them, but only under my supervision--not because I don't trust them, but because they're pricey. &nbsp;A set of six will run you about 15 bucks...plus tax. &nbsp;Their slogan should be, "These aren't Crayola prices!"</p><p>

The other day I was doing one of the things I do best...wasting time looking at projects I hope to one day get to on Pinterest. &nbsp;I ran across a cool and cheap alternative to Do-a-dot markers. &nbsp;It involved using wine bottle corks and regular paint to create art.</p><p>

On Wednesdays I hang out with a lovely three year-old named Sofia. &nbsp;I decided she'd be the perfect person to try out this new technique with. &nbsp;After I arrived at her house, we talked a bit about what's new with her, then we doodled:</p><table><tbody>

<tr><td>and I wrote down the new words we learned from her picture</td></tr>

Then we sang a couple of songs, and I read her a story:</p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p5X2PoFuruA/UWx_Bxd4B3I/AAAAAAAABPY/4CfOLHtohNA/s1600/foto+3.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p5X2PoFuruA/UWx_Bxd4B3I/AAAAAAAABPY/4CfOLHtohNA/s1600/foto+3.JPG"></a></p>

In the book, a baby bird hatches while his mother is away looking for food for him. &nbsp;He falls out of his nest and decides to go look for her. &nbsp;He meets a variety of animals and mistakes each one of them for his mom--there's a dog, a kitten, a cow, a hen, and more. &nbsp;It's a great story to enhance vocabulary for beginners. &nbsp;After the story was finished, I flipped back to the page with the tree that the baby bird had fallen from:</p>

I told Sofia we'd be making our own tree. &nbsp;First we folded our papers in half and drew our tree trunks on the bottom half:</p><table><tbody>

While we read the book and worked I'd stop periodically to write down and illustrate new words. &nbsp;Once we'd cleaned up I gave the vocabulary chart and the book to her mom to read and practice with her throughout the week.</p><p>

All in all, I'd recommend the cork painting as an alternative to do-a-dot--sure it's a bit more messy, but it's a heck of a lot cheaper, and more creative as well.</p></div>
