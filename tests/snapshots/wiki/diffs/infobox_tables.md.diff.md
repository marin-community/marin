Nepean Woods station - Wikipedia
================================

**Nepean Woods station** is located in the Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
suburb of Barrhaven, and is on the Southwest Transitway which is served
by OC Transpo buses. Located near the intersection of Woodroffe Avenue
and Strandherd Drive in southern Nepean, it was the westerly terminus of
most trips of rapid-transit route 74, formerly numbered route 94. It is
also the site of a park and ride lot for residents of Barrhaven, which
opened on 24 February 2014.

In 2014, selected trips on route 74 (then 94) were extended to/from
Riverview Station via the then-newly opened Vimy Memorial Bridge. Route
99 has selected trips extended via the bridge and Nepean Woods Station
to/from Barrhaven Centre Station. In 2024, in anticipation of the
opening of Line 2, Route 74 was extended to terminate at Limebank
station, connecting it to the new line.
