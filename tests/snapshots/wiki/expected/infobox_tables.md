Located near the intersection of Woodroffe Avenue and Strandherd Drive in southern Nepean, it was the westerly terminus of most trips of rapid-transit route 74, formerly numbered route 94. It is also the site of a park and ride lot for residents of Barrhaven, which opened on 24 February 2014. 

In 2014, selected trips on route 74 (then 94) were extended to/from Riverview Station via the then-newly opened Vimy Memorial Bridge. Route 99 has selected trips extended via the bridge and Nepean Woods Station to/from Barrhaven Centre Station.
