Appearance move to sidebar hide           From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia     ***Aquila*** is a monthly UK-based educational children's magazine that offers an alternative to mainstream publications. It is for boys and girls of 8-13 and features puzzles, fun facts and activities. The magazine is advertisement-free. Each issue revolves mainly around a specific topic, for example Captain Cook, Science Special, The Equator and Medieval Times \- all covered in 2013.<sup>\[1\]</sup> 

The "lively and informative"<sup>\[2\]</sup> magazine is aimed at bright pre-teenagers interested in hobbies beyond pop music and soaps, who "need to be able to feel good about themselves" and to realise that "there are other children out there like them" according to D J Taylor's article in *The Telegraph* in 2003.<sup>\[2\]</sup> 

*Aquila* was established in 1993 and is owned and run by New Leaf Publishing Ltd, a small independent publishing house situated in the coastal town of Eastbourne in England.<sup>\[3\]</sup> ATE Superweeks, a UK summer camp provider, works in association with *Aquila* magazine to run an annual summer camp. In 2012 the camp was called The Eco-Venture and had a focus on the environment.<sup>\[4\]</sup> 

## Features

A page where readers can send in letters, reviews, stories, or poems. **Pen Friend Club**

Each magazine features competitions. Every year, there is a "Finish the Story" challenge. Winners are always credited in later magazines and often their practical work will be reproduced. ### Features that no longer exist

\[edit\] **Wordworm** 

Once a feature related to English, in the earliest issues, Wordworm's pages regularly featured a list of words linked to the month's topic, with multiple choice definitions. The reader then had to identify the correct definition. **Magic Maths** (previously **Fun with Maths**) 

A page usually featuring number puzzles, but also occasionally introducing mathematical concepts and explaining them in detail. Examples of factual pages have included a feature on prime numbers, and the Golden Ratio.<sup>\[11\]</sup> Very occasionally, the page featured a biography of a famous mathematician. In later issues, it moved to the back of the magazine, and became half a page, and in September 2017, it was replaced by an activity to make a pomander,<sup>\[5\]</sup> and finally disappeared altogether to make more room for *Aquila News*.<sup>\[12\]</sup> **It's The Law** 

In older issues, "It's The Law" occasionally replaced *Aquila peers into the past...*, and it explained the laws that may affect Aquila readers, and how laws are passed. **On Track** 

An occasional feature which outlines the basic principles of many different sports from football to the less well known, or even invented games. **In Tune** 

A music page called "In Tune" runs occasionally. It has covered famous composers, choir singing and making music. **Paws for thought** 

The office terrier named Pepe has his own page where he has tips for pet owners, and articles about animals. \[edit\]  ## External links
