Title: Why do brushless drone motors tend to be more expensive than
brushed? The most common motors used for modern drones are brushless
outrunner motors and I have heard that they are simpler to manufacture
and are less susceptible to issues when being mass-produced than brushed
motors because the only parts of the brushless outrunner that rub
together are in the bearings (they don't require a brush to be at just
the right spot or pressure or anything). If this is the case, why do
brushless motors tend to be more expensive than brushed motors?

Brushed motors, on the other hand, have essentially no CNC'd parts,
almost everything is pressed or stamped including the can. Average
quality brushed motors with average tolerances and efficiency are cheap
and easy to produce. The cost with brushed motors comes when you need to
increase precision, performance, and efficiency. However the advent of
reasonably priced brushless motors has pretty much nullified that
market, so all we're left with us the first category except in very
narrow niche applications, none of which I've had the occasion to
explore yet.
