Question
========

Title: Is there a more fancy name for a "kitchen hole"? Does English
have a specific word for a hole between the kitchen and the living room
that is used to get food directly to the dining table?

German has the nice *Durchreiche*, which approximately translates to
*hand-through*. I am ideally looking for a nice translation of that
word.

A similar feature is a dumb-waiter, which is used to move crockery and
food between different levels especially in hotels.
