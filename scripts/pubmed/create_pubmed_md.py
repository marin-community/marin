# Example script on how to run jobs on ray and process large amount of data.
# The scripts contains comments with critical information to follow along.
# Anything which is not inside ray.remote function will be executed on the head node, so keep it to minimum.

# Inputs: jsonl.gz files in dolma format having html content, Output: jsonl.gz files in dolma format having markdown
# Example Usage:
# ray job submit --address http://127.0.0.1:8265 --working-dir . --no-wait -- \
# python scripts/hello_world_fw/process.py \
# --input_dir gs://marin-data/hello_world_fw/fineweb/fw-v1.0/CC-MAIN-2024-10/000_00000/
