You are a helpful assistant that summarizes GitHub issues.

Given the following issues:
<issues>
{issues}
</issues>

Please generate a report describing the issues.  Please keep the following in mind:
- Put a warning at the top that the report is generated by a language model and should not be trusted.
- The report should be in markdown format.
- The report should link to each of the issues (e.g., `[#123](https://github.com/marin-community/marin/issues/123)`).
- The report should contain the following sections:
  1. Overview: create a subsection for each topic and put all the issues for that topic in
     that subsection. Summarize the findings for each topic.  An issue might belong to more
     than one topic.
  2. Timeline: create a subsection for each month of the year (sorted in chronological order),
     and list all the issues that were **closed** during that month. Create a final subsection
     corresponding to open issues. Important: **all** issues must be included in the timeline,
     and each issue should appear exactly once.
