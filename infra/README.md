# Autoscaling Cluster for Marin Data Processing
In Marin, we use GCP TPUs (provided by TRC) to do all of our work, including non-training tasks.
We have three clusters for Marin, each with a different TPU type:

- `marin-us-central2` (default): v4's
- `marin-us-west4`: v5e's
- `marin-eu-west4`: v5e's

It is important to understand that almost all of our compute is preemptible. This means that the VMs can be shut down at
any time by Google, and we will lose all data on them. We have to design our jobs to be able to handle this, and we have
to be prepared for jobs to fail at any time.

## Our Cluster

At a high-level, this directory provides all setup scripts and configuration files for standing up a Ray Cluster and
interacting with it to do lightweight monitoring and reconfiguration. The architecture of our cluster is as follows:

- **Head Node**: A *persistent* (on-demand) [`n2-standard-8` GCP VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines) with 8 CPUs and 32 GB of
  RAM, and a 200 GB disk.
- **Worker Nodes**: An autoscaling number of **preemptible** TPU v4-8 or v5e VMs; a minimum of 4 VMs will be kept alive
 at all times, with a maximum of 1024 VMs alive at once (we can increase this number).

In the v4 cluster, we use v4-8's as our worker nodes. In the v5e clusters, we use v5e-1's as our worker nodes.

The head node is responsible for coordinating the cluster, while the worker nodes are responsible for executing the
actual tasks. In general, we try to avoid running any actual computation on the head node, as it is a shared resource.

## Ray

[Ray](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/running-applications/job-submission/index.html) provides a simple interface
for programmatically spinning up compute and scheduling/running jobs at scale. For Marin, we structure our data
processing jobs to be Ray compatible, so we can quickly parallelize across different nodes.

**Useful Documentation** -- Time-permitting, consult the official Ray documentation to learn more about how Ray works,
with helpful examples for working with Clusters and Jobs:
- [Ray Core](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/walkthrough.html): Provides a walkthrough of Ray "tasks" (atomic
  unit of work to be distributed), as well as `@ray.remote` syntax. For concrete code, try
  [this guide with examples](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/tasks.html).
- [Ray Jobs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/running-applications/job-submission/quickstart.html): Ray Jobs
  quickstart, with additional details about "special case" jobs (specifying CPUs, adding new Python packages).

  and [this repository for setting up with TPUs](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/tools/ray_tpu/src/serve).

### Structuring Code & Running Jobs

TODO: we should update this for the experiment framework

The way we're using Ray for data curation / processing is really as a distributed task queue -- we define an individual
Python script for each "job" (e.g., running a toxicity classifier on Reddit), breaking the computation into "tasks" that
are parallelized across the entire cluster.

A task is a "pure" function that operates over some atomic unit of the overall job (e.g., running the toxicity
classifier on a single Reddit thread). A good rule of thumb is to break a job down into individual tasks that can
complete within 1-10 minutes.

The following provides a simple sketch of what a job script might look like:

```python
from marin.toxicity import toxicity_classifier
from marin.utils import fsspec_exists

import fsspec
import ray


def get_sentinel_path(gcs_file_path: str) -> str:
    return f"{gcs_file_path}.COMPLETE"


def finalize_sentinel(sentinel_gcs_path: str, content: str = "Task Completed") -> None:
    with fsspec.open(sentinel_gcs_path, "w") as f:
        f.write(content)


# Task Function --> this actually will be parallelized across cluster workers
@ray.remote
def classify_reddit_toxicity(gcs_reddit_input: str, gcs_toxicity_output: str) -> bool:
    """Read from input, perform toxicity classification, write to output -- return success/failure."""

    # [Short-Circuit] If "sentinel" file exists, task has been successfully completed
    sentinel_gcs_path = get_sentinel_path(gcs_toxicity_output)
    if fsspec_exists(sentinel_gcs_path):
        return True

    # Read and validate `gcs_reddit_input`
    ...

    # Run toxicity classifier and get scores --> write to `gcs_toxicity_output` as you go!
    with fsspec.open(gcs_toxicity_output, "w", compression="infer") as out:
        ...

    # Finalize Sentinel
    finalize_sentinel(sentinel_gcs_path)

    return True


# Main Function (runs in a single processing on cluster head node) --> responsible for "dispatching" tasks
def run_toxicity_classifier_reddit() -> None:
    """Iterate over Reddit threads and run toxicity classifier."""

    # Load List of GCS Input Paths (e.g., one file for K threads)
    gcs_reddit_inputs: List[str] = [...]

    # Create Corresponding List of GCS Output Paths (to store toxicity scores)
    gcs_toxicity_outputs: List[str] = ["<...>" for input_path in gcs_reddit_inputs]

    # Initialize Connection to Ray Cluster
    ray.init()

    # Invoke / Dispatch Tasks (call .remote() --> return *promises* -- a list of references to task output)
    success_refs = []
    for i in range(len(gcs_reddit_inputs)):
        success_refs.append(classify_reddit_toxicity.remote(gcs_reddit_inputs[i], gcs_toxicity_outputs[i]))

    # Resolve / Verify Task Successes (call .get() on individual references)
    #   =>> TODO (siddk) :: There's actually a cleaner API for this that doesn't block on task ordering... fix!
    task_successes = {input_path: False for input_path in gcs_reddit_inputs}
    for i, input_path in enumerate(gcs_reddit_inputs):
        successful = ray.get(success_refs[i])  # Blocks until ready
        task_successes[input_path] = successful

    # Cleanup -- Write Successes / Failures to GCS
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_toxicity_classifier_reddit()
```

Note the "short-circuiting" structure of the `@ray.remote` decorated function `classify_reddit_toxicity`; in general,
writing your job scripts and tasks so that they are
[*idempotent*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1077412/what-is-an-idempotent-operation) (can be invoked multiple times, always returning the same output) is a good idea, and gracefully
handles cases where individual tasks crash or a VM worker gets preempted in the middle of running a task.

# Maintaining a Ray Cluster

We have 3 Marin clusters, based on where our TPU quota is available:

* `marin-us-central2` (default). v4's
* `marin-us-west4` v5e's
* `marin-eu-west4` v5e's
* `marin-us-east5` v6e's
* `marin-us-east1` v6e's

Each config is in a separate file in the `infra` directory. Thes files are automatically generated by the
`infra/update-cluster-configs.py` script, which reads the `infra/marin-cluster-template.yaml` file. **Do not edit the
`cluster.yaml` files directly**. Instead, edit the template file and run the script to update the cluster configs.**
For short term testing, it's fine to edit the `cluster.yaml` directly, but remember to update the template file and
regenerate the configs before merging.

```bash
export CLUSTER=us-central2

# Launch the Cluster -- will automatically provision the head node, and start configuring the minimum number of workers
ray up -y infra/marin-$CLUSTER.yaml

# Kill the Cluster (takes a while to gracefully terminate nodes)
ray down -y infra/marin-$CLUSTER.yaml

# Monitor the Ray Autoscaler Logs (in case there are problems spinning up workers)
#   =>> Note that `exec` lets you run arbitrary commands on the head node!
ray exec infra/marin-$CLUSTER.yaml "tail -n 100 -f /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor*"

# SSH into the Head Node
ray attach infra/marin-$CLUSTER.yaml
```

By default, each cluster is provisioned with a persistent `n2-standard-8` VM acting as
the head node. At any given time, there should be a minimum of 4 TPU `v4-8` VMs acting as workers, with an autoscaling
limit of 1024 VMs (so a maximum of 8 * 1024 = 8,192 total v4 cores or 4,096 v4 chips).

Each TPU `v4-8` VM actually has a surprising amount of CPUs and RAM (~240 CPUs, 200GB+ of RAM). However, Ray doesn't
actually do anything under the hood to ensure that a job is actually using the number of logical resources specified
(e.g., a job that on paper requests 1 CPU can use arbitrary cores/RAM). To mitigate this on the scheduler side,
the config file configures each worker with only 120 visible CPUs.

### Restarting the Cluster
There is currently an error on the Ray autoscaler side with spot-TPU instances, where the Ray autoscaler is not able
to detect when spot-TPU instances are dead and as a result, we may be left in a state with just the head node and
no more spot-TPU worker instances starting up. When this state occurs, please message in the #marin-infra slack
that you are going to restart the cluster (call `ray down infra/marin-$CLUSTER.yaml` and then `ray up infra/marin-$CLUSTER.yaml`).

**Important step for reserved workers**

If there are reserved workers, you all also need to take care to delete the reserved workers, then take down the cluster,
bring up the cluster and finally spin the reserved workers back up

To add manual workers from our reserved quota to cluster:
1. If rebooting, first go to **[Queued Resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/tpus?authuser=1&project=hai-gcp-models&tab=queuedResources&invt=AbuT6A)** and delete any existing queued resources for the zone you want to add workers for.
2. Go to **[VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?authuser=1&invt=AbuT6A&project=hai-gcp-models)** and find the head node for the zone you want (e.g., `us-central2-b`) and get its internal IP.
3. Run the following command to launch a manual worker:
```bash
python infra/manual_ray_worker_launch.py --cluster_yaml infra/marin-us-central2.yaml --reserved --tpu_type v4-128 --head $IP --zone us-central2-b
```
4. Repeat step 3 as needed to launch additional manual workers.

Please note that after restarting the cluster and queueing the first job, it will likely stall because it takes a while
for the head node to actually spin up the worker sometimes (~10min).

To recap the full process for restarting the cluster is as follows:

```bash
# 1. First, delete any existing queued resources for the zone
# Go to Queued Resources in GCP Console and delete existing resources

# 2. Delete any queued workers
# Go to VM instances in GCP Console and delete queued workers

# 3. Delete any reserved workers
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm list --project=hai-gcp-models --zone $CLUSTER

# Example output format:
# NAME                                    ZONE        ACCELERATOR_TYPE  TYPE  TOPOLOGY  NETWORK  RANGE          STATUS
# ray-marin-{cluster}-worker-{id}-tpu     {zone}      v6e-4            V6E   2x2       default  10.202.0.0/20  READY
# ray-marin-{cluster}-worker-{id}-tpu     {zone}      v6e-8            V6E   2x4       default  10.202.0.0/20  READY
# ray-marin-{cluster}-worker-{id}-tpu     {zone}      v6e-64           V6E   8x8       default  10.202.0.0/20  DELETING
# WORKER_NAME below is which one of the workers above you want to delete

gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm delete $WORKER_NAME --zone $CLUSTER --project hai-gcp-models

# 4. Take down the cluster
ray down -y infra/marin-$CLUSTER.yaml

# 5. Bring up the cluster
ray up -y infra/marin-$CLUSTER.yaml

# 6. Get the head node's internal IP
# Go to VM instances in GCP Console and find the head node's internal IP

# 7. Add reserved workers back (repeat for each worker needed)
python infra/manual_ray_worker_launch.py --cluster_yaml infra/marin-$CLUSTER.yaml \
       --reserved --tpu_type $TPU_TYPE --head $IP --zone $ZONE

# 8. Monitor the cluster startup
ray exec infra/marin-$CLUSTER.yaml "tail -n 100 -f /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor*"

# Note: After restarting and queueing the first job, it may stall for ~10 minutes
# while the head node spins up workers
```

If you want the command below will delete all reserved workers **BE VERY CAREFUL**
not to delete workers others are running jobs on. It will only be necessary for full resets
```bash
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm list --project=hai-gcp-models --zone $CLUSTER | grep "ray-marin-$CLUSTER-worker" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I {} gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm delete {} --zone $CLUSTER --project hai-gcp-models --quiet
```
Note that some clusters have an extra letter at the end so you'll need to change the work template i.e.
```bash
export CLUSTER=us-east5-b
gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm list --project=hai-gcp-models --zone $CLUSTER | grep "ray-marin-us-east5-worker" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I {} gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm delete {} --zone $CLUSTER --project hai-gcp-models --quiet
```
Where:
- `$CLUSTER` is the cluster name (e.g., `us-central2`, `us-west4`, or `eu-west4`)
- `$IP` is the head node's internal IP address
- `$ZONE` is the GCP zone (e.g., `us-central2-b`)

Remember to:
1. Message in the #marin-infra Slack channel before restarting
2. Wait for the cluster to fully initialize before running jobs
3. Be patient with the first job after restart as it may take ~10 minutes for workers to spin up

### Reconfiguring the Cluster

To reconfigure the cluster, you should generally modify the `infra/update-cluster-configs.py` script or the template
file `infra/marin-cluster-template.yaml` and not modify the `cluster.yaml` directly. This script will update all the
cluster configs in the `infra` directory with your changes.

In general, for additive operations like increasing the `max_workers` for autoscaling, you can just call `ray up`
against the already-running cluster. For larger changes, like changing the machine type of the workers, you should bring
the cluster down (`ray down`) and then bring it back up (`ray up`).

If you need to change something else about the cluster, e.g. if you're changing any of the initialization/setup
commands, it's best to bring the entire cluster down (`ray down`), *then edit the `marin-cluster-template.yaml`*, and
then bring the cluster back up (`ray up`); note that this will kill all VMs, including the head node.

#### Docker Image

If you need to make substantive changes to the machine software, you should change the Docker file at
`docker/marin/Dockerfile.cluster`. Then run `make cluster_docker` to rebuild the Docker image and push it to the
Google Artifact Registry. (Note that by default this will update the dockers for all clusters; if you only want to update it for one cluster, you can modify `CLUSTER_REPOS` variable in the Makefile). This will create a new image and a new tag, of the form
`"us-central2-docker.pkg.dev/hai-gcp-models/marin/marin_cluster:<TAG>"`. Tags can include the latest commit hash and the
date, for example:

```makefile
CLUSTER_REPOS = us-central2 europe-west4 us-west4
TAG_VERSIONS = latest $(shell git rev-parse --short HEAD) $(shell date -u +"%Y%m%d")
```

The `cluster_docker` command will handle creating artifact repositories if they don't exist, building the Docker image,
tagging it, and pushing it to all relevant regions and versions. If you run into a permissions error (e.g., 403) when pushing the Docker image, you may need to authenticate to the repo:

``` diff
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central2-docker.pkg.dev
gcloud auth configure-docker europe-west4-docker.pkg.dev
gcloud auth configure-docker us-west4-docker.pkg.dev
```

(`make cluster_docker` ought to do those steps for you, but just in case.)

After building the Docker image and pushing it to the relevant regions and versions, update the `infra/update-cluster-configs.py` script to point to the new image and regenerate the cluster configs. For instance, if you updated the `europe-west` cluster you can update the tags as below:

```diff
- DOCKER_TAGS = {
-    "us-central2": "20241022",
-    "us-west4": "20241022",
-    "europe-west4": "20241022",
-}
DOCKER_TAGS = {
    "us-central2": "20241022",
    "us-west4": "20241022",
    "europe-west4": "20241024",
}
```

Then run `python infra/update-cluster-configs.py` to regenerate the cluster configs. This will update each cluster
config in the `infra` directory with the corresponding new Docker image tag.

After that, you can restart each cluster with `ray down` and `ray up`.

**If you use a cluster, please use the corresponding bucket, as data transfer costs between regions are high**

If you need to change something else about the cluster, e.g. if you're changing any of the initialization/setup
commands, it's best to bring the entire cluster down (`ray down`), *then edit the `cluster.yaml`*, and then bring the
cluster back up (`ray up`); note that this will kill all VMs, including the head node (nothing lasts forever).

**Word of Warning**: Ray looks at the actual `cluster_name` and various worker names/configs to "identify" existing/new
clusters. To prevent orphaned states, do not change the names of the clusters without first bringing
the cluster down!


#### Environment Variables

We are currently using Google Secret Manager to store the environment variables that are needed to run the cluster.
You can edit those secrets by going to the Google Cloud Console and navigating to the Secret Manager. Once you add
a new version, you can cause the changes to propagate by killing the workers or restarting the cluster.


### Adding TPU Nodes Manually to the Cluster

Ray only supports on demand and preemptible TPUs. For reserved nodes, we need to add them manually to the cluster.

We have a modified version of the Levanter launch script that mostly automates this process. For example:

```bash
python infra/manual_ray_worker_launch.py --cluster_yaml infra/marin-us-central2.yaml \
       --reserved --tpu_type v4-128
```

This command will take a couple of minutes to run and then exit. You don't need to run this in a tmux or anything like
that. You can run it from your laptop.

If you want to change that to, say, two v4-64s, you need to delete the TPU node (using the GCP console) and then run the
command again with the new TPU type.
